  "content": "# Rollback Validator\n\nValidate that every rollback path defined in the migration plan actually works. Test downgrade procedures, verify data reversibility, measure rollback time, and confirm that the system returns to a fully functional pre-migration state. This is the safety net that must be proven before any migration reaches production.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- Before deploying any migration phase to production\n- After the compatibility checker has run and breaking changes are cataloged\n- Before a production cutover or feature flag flip\n- When the migration plan includes data transformations that must be reversible\n- As a gate check: no migration proceeds without validated rollback\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Identify rollback triggers** - Define the specific conditions that would require a rollback: error rate threshold, latency spike, data corruption signal, failed health checks, or manual decision criteria. These must be measurable and unambiguous.\n2. **Test data reversibility** - Apply the forward migration to a copy of production data, then apply the rollback. Compare the result to the original. Verify no data loss, no corruption, and no orphaned records. Pay special attention to auto-incremented IDs, timestamps, and generated values.\n3. **Verify schema downgrade** - Run the schema downgrade scripts against a migrated database. Confirm the schema matches the pre-migration state exactly. Test that the old application code runs correctly against the downgraded schema.\n4. **Test service rollback procedure** - Execute the full rollback procedure as documented: redeploy old version, revert configuration, re-enable old feature flags, restore old routes. Verify the procedure is complete (no missing steps).\n5. **Measure rollback time** - Time the full rollback procedure end-to-end. Compare against the SLA or acceptable downtime window. If rollback takes too long, identify optimizations or consider a different migration strategy.\n6. **Verify no data loss on rollback** - After rollback, run data integrity checks. Compare record counts, checksums, and critical business data against pre-migration baselines. Any discrepancy is a blocking issue.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n| Deliverable | Format | Purpose |\n|-------------|--------|---------|\n| ROLLBACK-REPORT.md | Markdown | Rollback validation results |\n\n### ROLLBACK-REPORT.md Contents\n\n- **Rollback Triggers**: The conditions that would activate a rollback, with thresholds\n- **Data Reversibility Results**: Before/after comparison, record counts, checksums\n- **Schema Downgrade Results**: Schema diff confirming match to pre-migration state\n- **Service Rollback Results**: Step-by-step execution log with pass/fail per step\n- **Rollback Time**: Measured duration vs SLA target\n- **Data Integrity Verification**: Record counts, checksums, spot-check results\n- **Verdict**: Ready to proceed / blocking issues found\n- **Blocking Issues**: Any failures that must be resolved before migration proceeds\n\n## Quality Criteria\n\n- Rollback is tested end-to-end, not just individual steps in isolation\n- Data loss is confirmed zero: record counts and checksums match pre-migration baselines\n- Rollback time is measured and within the acceptable window (documented SLA)\n- Schema downgrade produces an exact match to the pre-migration schema\n- Old application code runs correctly against the rolled-back state\n- Rollback triggers are specific and measurable (no vague criteria like \"if things look bad\")\n- All blocking issues are resolved before the migration proceeds to production",
