      "content": "# Pattern Recognition Reference\n\nIdentifying effective action patterns.\n\n## What is a Pattern?\n\nA pattern is a repeatable action approach that:\n- Works consistently across situations\n- Has predictable impact\n- Can be applied to similar contexts\n\n## Pattern Categories\n\n### By Action Type\n\n**Engagement Patterns:**\n- How to get stakeholder meetings\n- How to expand relationships\n- How to reactivate cold contacts\n\n**Enablement Patterns:**\n- What materials work for champions\n- How to arm for internal selling\n- What content converts\n\n**Technical Patterns:**\n- What demos convert\n- How to pass technical evaluation\n- Integration proof approaches\n\n**Close Patterns:**\n- Proposal approaches that work\n- Negotiation tactics\n- How to get signature\n\n### By Stakeholder Type\n\n**Champion Patterns:**\n- How to identify champions\n- How to enable champions\n- How to maintain champion engagement\n\n**Decision-Maker Patterns:**\n- How to get DM meetings\n- What resonates with DMs\n- How to get DM approval\n\n**Blocker Patterns:**\n- How to convert blockers\n- How to neutralize blockers\n- When to work around\n\n### By Deal Context\n\n**Industry Patterns:**\n- What works in e-commerce\n- What works in healthcare\n- Industry-specific approaches\n\n**Size Patterns:**\n- Enterprise vs. mid-market\n- Different stakeholder structures\n- Buying process variations\n\n**Stage Patterns:**\n- Discovery best practices\n- Demo winning approaches\n- Close acceleration tactics\n\n---\n\n## Pattern Detection\n\n### Signal Identification\n\nLook for:\n- Same action working multiple times\n- Consistent outcome from approach\n- High effectiveness ratings\n- Similar contexts, similar results\n\n### Minimum Evidence\n\nBefore establishing pattern:\n- At least 3 occurrences\n- Consistent effectiveness (>70%)\n- Clear context match\n- Explainable mechanism\n\n### Pattern Strength\n\n| Occurrences | Consistency | Strength |\n|-------------|-------------|----------|\n| 3-5 | >70% | Emerging |\n| 6-10 | >80% | Established |\n| 10+ | >90% | Strong |\n\n---\n\n## Pattern Documentation\n\n### Pattern Template\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"PATTERN-001\",\n  \"name\": \"Champion-enabled stakeholder intro\",\n  \"category\": \"engagement\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"when\": \"Need to engage new

  {\"deal\": \"techcorp\", \"result\": \"CFO meeting scheduled\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### What is an Anti-Pattern?\n\nAction approaches that:\n- Consistently don't work\n- Have predictable negative effects\n- Should be avoided\n\n### Common Anti-Patterns\n\n| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| Cold CEO outreach | No relationship, low response |\n| Going around champion | Damages trust |\n| Proposal before discovery | Misses needs |\n| Technical depth with exec | Wrong level |\n| Generic content | Doesn't resonate |\n| Multiple follow-ups (>3) | Appears desperate |\n| Discounting first | Sets wrong anchor |\n\n### Anti-Pattern Documentation\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"ANTI-001\",\n  \"name\": \"Cold executive outreach\",\n  \"category\": \"engagement\",\n  \"description\": \"Reaching out to C-level without introduction\",\n  \"whyItFails\": [\n    \"Low response rate (<5%)\",\n    \"May damage relationship if discovered\",\n    \"Wastes time and credibility\"\n  ],\n  \"alternative\": \"Champion-enabled intro or peer referral\",\n  \"occurrences\": 8,\n  \"failureRate\": 0.94\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Pattern Application\n\n### Matching Context\n\nBefore applying pattern, verify:\n- Similar situation\n- Prerequisites met\n- No contradicting factors\n- Reasonable expectation of success\n\n### Adaptation\n\nPatterns may need adjustment for:\n- Industry differences\n- Company size\n- Stakeholder personality\n- Deal stage\n\n### Tracking\n\nWhen applying pattern:\n- Note that pattern was used\n- Track outcome\n- Update pattern metrics\n- Note any variations\n\n---\n\n## Learning Loop\n\n### Pattern Evolution\n\n```\nAction → Outcome → Analysis → Pattern Update → Better Action\n```\n\n### Updating Patterns\n\nAfter each occurrence:\n1. Record outcome\n2. Update success rate\n3. Note any variations\n4. Refine pattern if needed\n\n### Retiring Patterns\n\nPatterns should be retired if:\n- Success rate drops below 50%\n- Context has changed (market, product)\n- Better alternative discovered\n- Too few recent occurrences\n\n---\n\n## Pattern Sharing\n\n### Cross-Deal Learning\n\nPatterns learned from one deal should inform others:\n- Similar industry\n- Similar size\n- Similar stage\n- Similar stakeholder types\n\n### Pattern Library\n\nMaintain central library:\n- Engagement patterns\n- Enablement patterns\n- Technical patterns\n- Close patterns\n- Anti-patterns\n\n### Pattern Review\n\nRegularly:\n- Review pattern performance\n- Identify emerging patterns\n- Retire stale patterns\n- Share insights\n"
