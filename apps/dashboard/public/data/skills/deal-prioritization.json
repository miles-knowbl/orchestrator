Rank all deals by value\n2. Calculate percentile\n3. Convert to score\n\n| Percentile | Score Range |\n|------------|-------------|\n| 90-100% | 95-100 |\n| 75-89% | 80-94 |\n| 50-74% | 60-79 |\n| 25-49% | 40-59 |\n| 0-24% | 20-39 |\n\n**Adjustments:**\n- Strategic account: +10\n- Expansion opportunity: +5\n- Reference potential: +5\n\n**Example:**\n```\nDeal: $250K\nPipeline: $50K, $100K, $150K, $200K, $250K, $300K, $400K\nPercentile: 71st\nBase Score: 71\nStrategic: No\nFinal Value Factor: 71\n```\n\n### Factor 2: Health (25%)\n\n**Purpose:** Focus on winnable deals.\n\n**Calculation:** Direct from Deal Health score.\n\n| Health Score | Factor Score |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| 80-100 | 80-100 |\n| 60-79 | 60-79 |\n| 40-59 | 40-59 |\n| 20-39 | 20-39 |\n| 0-19 | 0-19 |\n\n**Why 1:1 mapping:**\n- Health already incorporates multiple factors\n- Simple and transparent\n- Easy to understand impact\n\n**Note:** Very low health (<30) may indicate deal should be deprioritized regardless of value.\n\n### Factor 3: Urgency (25%)\n\n**Purpose:** Time-sensitive deals need immediate attention.\n\n**Components:**\n1. **Decision timeline** (when they'll decide)\n2. **Deadline pressure** (external forcing function)\n3. **Competitive pressure** (competitor activity)\n\n**Decision Timeline Score:**\n\n| Timeline | Score |\n|----------|-------|\n| This week | 100 |\n| Next 2 weeks | 85 |\n| This month | 70 |\n| Next 2 months | 55 |\n| This quarter | 40 |\n| Next quarter | 25 |\n| No timeline | 30 |\n| 6+ months | 15 |\n\n**Adjustments:**\n- Hard deadline: +15\n- Active competitor: +10\n- Quarter/year end: +10\n- Budget expiring: +15\n\n**Example:**\n```\nDecision: This month (70)\nHard deadline: Yes (+15)\nCompetitor: No\nFinal Urgency Factor: 85\n```\n\n### Factor 4: Movability (20%)\n\n**Purpose:** Prioritize deals that will actually move with effort.\n\n**Definition:** Likelihood that investing time will advance the deal.\n\n**Scoring:**\n\n| Situation | Score |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Clear next step, champion pushing | 95-100 |\n| Next step agreed, good momentum | 80-94 |\n| Path forward, some uncertainty | 65-79 |\n| Possible path, obstacles exist | 50-64 |\n| Unclear, needs exploration | 35-49 |\n| Blocked, no clear path | 20-34 |\n| Stuck, unlikely to move | 0-19 |\n\n**High Movability Indicators:**\n- Champion actively engaged\n- Next meeting scheduled\n- Specific action will advance\n- No blockers identified\n- Momentum visible\n\n**Low Movability Indicators:**\n- Champion gone cold\n- No clear next step\n- Blocked by external factor\n- Waiting on them\n- Multiple failed attempts\n\n---\n\n## Combined Formula\n\n```\nPriority Score = (Value × 0.30) + (Health × 0.25) +\n                 (Urgency × 0.25) + (Movability × 0.20)\n```\n\n### Example Calculation\n\n**Deal: ShopCo**\n- Value: $250K (71st percentile) → Value Factor: 71\n- Health: 72 → Health Factor: 72\n- Timeline: This month, hard deadline → Urgency Factor: 85\n- Movability: Clear next step, champion engaged → Movability Factor: 88\n\n```\nPriority = (71 × 0.30) + (72 × 0.25) + (85 × 0.25) + (88 × 0.20)\n         = 21.3 + 18.0 + 21.25 + 17.6\n         = 78.15\n```\n\n**Result:** Priority Score 78 → Focus Tier\n\n---\n\n## Factor Weight Rationale\n\n| Factor | Weight | Why |\n|--------|--------|-----|\n| Value | 30% | Revenue impact |\n| Health | 25% | Win probability |\n| Urgency | 25% | Time sensitivity |\n| Movability | 20% | Effort efficiency |\n\n### Alternative Weightings\n\n**Value-Heavy (revenue focus):**\n- Value: 40%, Health: 25%, Urgency: 20%, Movability: 15%\n\n**Velocity-Heavy (close fast):**\n- Value: 25%, Health: 20%, Urgency: 35%, Movability: 20%\n\n**Quality-Heavy (win rate focus):**\n- Value: 20%, Health: 35%, Urgency: 20%, Movability: 25%\n\n---\n\n## Override Conditions\n\nSometimes override calculated priority:\n\n| Condition | Override |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Executive request | Move to Focus |\n| Strategic account | Move up one tier |\n| At risk of loss | Move to Focus for intervention |\n| Blocked externally | Move to Monitor |\n| Waiting on customer | Move down one tier |\n\n---\n\n## Validation Questions\n\nBefore finalizing priority:\n\n1. **Does this feel right?** (Sanity check)\n2. **Am I over-prioritizing small deals?**\n3. **Am I ignoring at-risk big deals?**\n4. **Can I actually act on Focus tier?**\n5. **Is anything urgent being missed?**\n"

Review priority list\n2. Identify critical actions\n3. Schedule Focus tier activities\n4. Block time for Maintain tier\n5. Note Monitor checks\n\n### Daily Execution\n\n| Time Block | Activity |\n|------------|----------|\n| Morning | Focus tier — deep work |\n| Mid-day | Meetings |\n| Afternoon | Maintain tier — keep moving |\n| End of day | Quick checks, admin |\n\n### Friday Review (30 min)\n\n1.

Did Focus tier get 60% of time?\n2. Did any deal get zero attention?\n3. Was effort aligned to priority?\n4. What would I do differently?\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n| Mistake | Correction |\n|---------|------------|\n| Equal time all deals | Follow tier allocation |\n| Ignoring Focus deals | Daily attention required |\n| Over-investing in leads | Quick qualify/disqualify |\n| Reactive not proactive | Plan the week ahead |\n| Meetings without prep | Prep is part of effort |\n"
