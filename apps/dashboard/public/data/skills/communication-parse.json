What category? (volume, cost, quality, speed, compliance, security, experience, talent, legacy, integration)\n2. How severe? Use these indicators:\n   - HIGH: Explicit urgency words, executive attention, business impact stated\n   - MEDIUM: Acknowledged problem, seeking solutions\n   - LOW: Minor frustration, future concern\n3. Who mentioned it?\n4. Exact quote capturing the pain\n5. Is this a new pain point or reinforcement of known issue?\n```\n\n### Budget Signal Extraction\n\nWhen financial signals may be present:\n\n```\nExtract all budget-related signals from this communication.\n\nLook for:\n1. EXPLICIT: \"Budget is X\", \"We have Y allocated\"\n2. RANGE: \"Between X and Y\", \"Up to X\"\n3. COMPARISON: \"We pay X for current solution\"\n4. TIMING: \"Budget cycle in Q4\", \"New fiscal year\"\n5. AUTHORITY: Who controls budget? Who has sign-off?\n6.

FISCAL TIMING: \"End of fiscal year\", \"Budget renewal\"\n5. URGENCY INDICATORS: \"ASAP\", \"urgent\", \"can't wait\"\n6. COMPETING PRIORITIES: Other projects, resource constraints\n\nFor each signal:\n- Quote the relevant text\n- Convert to specific date if possible\n- Rate urgency (high/medium/low)\n- Note dependencies or conditions\n```\n\n### Stakeholder Mapping\n\nWhen new contacts or power dynamics are mentioned:\n\n```\nAnalyze stakeholder information in this communication.\n\nFor each person mentioned:\n1. Name and title (as stated)\n2. Role in decision:\n   - CHAMPION: Actively selling internally\n   - INFLUENCER: Has input but not final say\n   - DECISION MAKER: Has authority to approve\n   - BLOCKER: May oppose or slow deal\n   - END USER: Will use the solution\n3. Sentiment indicators:\n   - POSITIVE: Enthusiastic, engaged, advocating\n   - NEUTRAL: Open but not committed\n   - SKEPTICAL: Has concerns, needs convincing\n   - NEGATIVE: Actively resistant\n4. Power indicators:\n   - Budget authority\n   - Technical authority\n   - Organizational influence\n5. Relationship to other stakeholders\n```\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\nWhen technical details are discussed:\n\n```\nExtract technical requirements from this communication.\n\nCategories:\n1. INTEGRATION: Systems that must connect\n2. SECURITY: Auth, compliance, data handling\n3. SCALE: Volume, performance, capacity\n4. DEPLOYMENT: Cloud, on-prem, hybrid\n5. EXISTING SYSTEMS: Current tech stack\n\nFor each requirement:\n- Specific requirement description\n- Category\n- Priority (must-have/nice-to-have/future)\n- Quote if explicitly stated\n- Potential complexity (low/medium/high)\n```\n\n## Prompt Chaining\n\nFor complex communications, chain prompts:\n\n### Step 1: Initial Scan\n```\nRead this communication and identify which signal categories are present:\n- Pain Points: [Yes/No]\n- Budget: [Yes/No]\n- Timeline: [Yes/No]\n- Stakeholders: [Yes/No]\n- Technical: [Yes/No]\n- Competitive: [Yes/No]\n- AI Maturity: [Yes/No]\n- Use Case: [Yes/No]\n\nFor categories marked Yes, briefly note what's there.\n```\n\n### Step 2: Deep Extraction\nRun category-specific prompts only for categories identified in Step 1.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesis\n```\nGiven these extracted signals:\n{extracted_signals}\n\nSynthesize:\n1. What's the single most important new insight?\n2. What score should change and by how much?\n3. What action should we take next?\n4. What questions remain unanswered?\n```\n\n## Handling Ambiguity\n\nWhen signals are unclear:\n\n```\nThis signal is ambiguous: \"{signal}\"\n\nPossible interpretations:\nA) {interpretation_a}\nB) {interpretation_b}\n\nBased on context:\n- Deal stage: {stage}\n- Known information: {context}\n- Speaker history: {speaker_info}\n\nWhich interpretation is more likely? Assign confidence level.\n```\n\n## Confidence Calibration\n\nUse this to validate confidence levels:\n\n| Confidence | Criteria | Example |\n|------------|----------|---------|\n| explicit | Direct statement, no interpretation needed | \"Our budget is $300K\" |\n| strong-inference | Clear implication from context | \"Finance approved\" → budget exists |\n| inference | Reasonable conclusion | Big company + urgent need → likely has budget |\n| weak | Speculation | Industry average suggests X |\n\n## Output Templates\n\n### Quick Summary\n```\n{communication_id}\nKey Signals:\n- {signal_1}\n- {signal_2}\nScore Impacts: {score}: {change}\nNext: {recommended_action}\n```\n\n### Full Extraction\n```json\n{\n  \"communicationId\": \"\",\n  \"parsedAt\": \"\",\n  \"signalSummary\": {\n    \"painPoints\": 0,\n    \"budgetConfirmed\": false,\n    \"timelineConfirmed\": false,\n    \"newStakeholders\": 0,\n    \"technicalRequirements\": 0\n  },\n  \"signals\": { ... },\n  \"scoreImpacts\": { ... },\n  \"nextActions\": []\n}\n```\n"

Use Case Signals\n\n### Clarity Levels\n\n| Level | Indicators |\n|-------|------------|\n| exploring | \"We need AI\" with no specifics |\n| defined | Clear automation target identified |\n| scoped | Requirements documented, prototype-ready |\n\n### Use Case Extraction Template\n\n```json\n{\n  \"primary\": \"Tier 1 chat support for returns/exchanges\",\n  \"secondary\": [\"FAQ automation\", \"Authentication help\"],\n  \"clarity\": \"defined\",\n  \"scope\": \"Customer-facing chat only, not internal\",\n  \"successCriteria\": \"Reduce ticket volume by 30%\",\n  \"source\": \"2026-02-03-meeting-discovery.md\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Signal Confidence Rules\n\n### Explicit (Direct Statement)\n\n- Exact quote available\n- Speaker identified\n- No interpretation needed\n\n### Strong Inference\n\n- Clear implication\n- Context supports conclusion\n- Would be understood by any reader\n\n### Inference\n\n- Reasonable conclusion\n- Based on industry norms or patterns\n- Some interpretation required\n\n### Weak\n\n- Speculation\n- Limited evidence\n- Could be wrong\n\n**Rule:** When in doubt, lower the confidence level.\n"
