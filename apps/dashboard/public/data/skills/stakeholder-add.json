      "content": "# Stakeholder Roles Reference\n\nDetailed definitions for buying committee roles.\n\n## Role: Champion\n\n**Definition:** Your internal advocate who actively sells on your behalf when you're not in the room.\n\n### Identification Signals\n\nStrong Champion:\n- Proactively shares information about internal dynamics\n- Makes introductions without being asked\n- Expresses urgency (\"We need this\")\n- Asks \"how can we make this happen?\"\n- Defends you against internal skeptics\n- Provides competitive intelligence\n- Coaches you on how to navigate their org\n\nModerate Champion:\n- Responds quickly and thoroughly\n- Shares some internal context\n- Willing to make introductions when asked\n- Engaged in meetings\n\nWeak Champion:\n- Interested but passive\n- Doesn't advocate internally\n- Waits for you to drive everything\n- May be too junior to influence\n\n### Your Job With Champions\n\n1. **Enable them** — Give them ammunition (one-pagers, ROI calcs)\n2. **Coach them** — Help them sell internally\n3. **Protect them** — Don't make them look bad\n4. **Appreciate them** — Acknowledge their help\n5. **Keep them informed** — No surprises\n\n### Champion Strength Scoring\n\n| Level | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Executive Sponsor | C-level backing, can override objections |\n| Strong | Senior with budget/decision authority, actively advocating |\n| Moderate | Mid-level with some influence, engaged but limited power |\n| Weak | Interested individual, no real authority |\n\n---\n\n## Role: Decision-Maker\n\n**Definition:** Has authority to approve budget, sign contracts, or make final go/no-go decision.\n\n### Identification Signals\n\n- Title typically VP, Director, C-level, or \"Head of\"\n- Others defer to their opinion\n- Controls or influences budget discussions\n- Asked for approval before proceeding\n- Final sign-off mentioned\n\n### Types of Decision-Makers\n\n**Economic Buyer:**\n- Controls the budget\n- Cares about ROI, cost, business impact\n- Usually CFO, VP, or budget owner\n\n**Technical Buyer:**\n- Approves technical fit\n- Cares about integration, security, scalability\n- Usually CTO, VP Engineering, IT Director\n\n**Executive Sponsor:**\n- Strategic decision authority\n- Cares about vision, competitive advantage\n- Usually C-level or SVP\n\n### Your Job With Decision-Makers\n\n1. **Build credibility** — They need to trust you\n2. **Address their concerns** — Usually different from champions\n3. **Speak their language** — Business impact for economic, technical depth for technical\n4. **Respect their time** — Be concise, prepared\n5. **Get access** — Many deals die without DM engagement\n\n### Decision-Maker Engagement Risk\n\n| Days Since Last DM Contact | Risk Level |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| < 7 days | Low |\n| 7-14 days | Medium |\n| 14-30 days | High |\n| > 30 days | Critical |\n\n---\n\n## Role: Influencer\n\n**Definition:** Affects the decision through advice, evaluation, or usage but doesn't make final call.\n\n### Types of Influencers\n\n**Technical Evaluator:**\n- Runs POCs, evaluates features\n- Creates comparison scorecards\n- Reports findings to decision-makers\n\n**End User:**\n- Will use the solution daily\n- Can champion or block based on usability\n- Often consulted by decision-makers\n\n**Trusted Advisor:**\n- Has decision-maker's ear\n- May be consultant, long-time employee, or expert\n- Opinion carries weight\n\n**Peer:**\n- Same level as decision-maker in different department\n- May have implemented similar solutions\n- Reference point for decision-maker\n\n### Your Job With Influencers\n\n1. **Win their support** — Make them advocates\n2. **Address their criteria** — Understand what they're evaluating\n3. **Make them look good** — Help them give positive reports\n4. **Don't ignore them** — They can become blockers\n\n---\n\n## Role: Blocker\n\n**Definition:** Actively or passively resisting the deal moving forward.\n\n### Types of Blockers\n\n**Active Blocker:**\n- Openly opposes the solution\n- Raises objections in meetings\n- Advocates for alternatives\n\n**Passive Blocker:**\n- Doesn't engage\n- Delays providing information\n- Creates process obstacles\n- \"Busy\" when meetings scheduled\n\n**Competitive Blocker:**\n- Favors a competitor\n- May have existing relationship\n- Introduces competitor late in process\n\n**Status Quo Blocker:**\n- Prefers to do nothing\n- \"If it ain't broke...\"\n- Risk-averse\n\n### Your Job With Blockers\n\n1. **Understand their concerns** — Often legitimate\n2. **Address if possible** — Some concerns are solvable\n3. **Isolate if necessary** — Work around if won't engage\n4. **Convert if you can** — Blockers who flip become strong advocates\n5. **Don't ignore** — They don't go away\n\n### Blocker Handling Strategies\n\n| Blocker Type | Strategy |\n|--------------|----------|\n| Technical concerns | Deep-dive, proof points, reference calls |\n| Political/competitive | Find their win, executive alignment |\n| Risk-averse | Risk mitigation, phased approach, guarantees |\n| Budget-conscious | ROI proof,

**Provide proof** — Documentation, demos, references\n3. **Be responsive** — Answer questions quickly and thoroughly\n4. **Differentiate** — Make sure your strengths are weighted\n5. **Build relationship** — They may become influencer or champion\n\n---\n\n## Buying Committee Patterns\n\n### Healthy Deal\n- Strong Champion\n- At least one engaged Decision-Maker\n- Evaluators reporting positive findings\n- No active Blockers\n\n### At-Risk Deal\n- Weak Champion\n- Decision-Makers not engaged\n- Active Blocker with no mitigation\n- Evaluators have unanswered concerns\n\n### Red Flag Deal\n- No Champion\n- Can't access Decision-Makers\n- Multiple Blockers\n- Competitive Evaluator\n\n## Role Evolution\n\nStakeholders can change roles:\n\n| From | To | Why |\n|------|-----|-----|\n| Evaluator | Champion | Impressed by solution |\n| Neutral DM | Supportive DM | Concerns addressed |\n| Influencer | Blocker | Ignored or mishandled |\n| Champion | Former Champion | Left company, changed role |\n\nUpdate roles as you learn more—initial assessment often wrong.\n"
