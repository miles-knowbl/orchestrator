discussions\n\n### Weak Signals (Low Confidence)\n\n- Company size (larger ≠ more mature)\n- Industry (tech ≠ more mature)\n- Enthusiasm (interest ≠ capability)\n- Timeline pressure (urgency ≠ readiness)\n\n---\n\n## Probing Questions\n\nWhen signals unclear, ask:\n\n**Experience:**\n- \"Have you implemented AI solutions before?\"\n- \"What AI tools are you currently using?\"\n- \"What did you learn from past AI projects?\"\n\n**Capability:**\n- \"Do you have data science resources?\"\n- \"Where does your training data live?\"\n- \"What's your current tech stack?\"\n\n**Strategy:**\n- \"Is there executive sponsorship for AI?\"\n- \"Where does this fit in your priorities?\"\n- \"Is there dedicated budget for this?\"\n\n**Readiness:**\n- \"What would make this successful for you?\"\n- \"Who would be involved in implementation?\"\n- \"What's your change management approach?\"\n"
