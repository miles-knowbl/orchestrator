assumptions\n- Company size implications\n- Generic \"evaluating options\"\n- No competitive mentions (doesn't mean no competition)\n\n---\n\n## Documentation Requirements\n\nFor each competitor, capture:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Competitor Name\",\n  \"type\": \"direct|adjacent|internal|status-quo\",\n  \"status\": \"active|past-user|eliminated|preferred|unknown\",\n  \"sentiment\":
