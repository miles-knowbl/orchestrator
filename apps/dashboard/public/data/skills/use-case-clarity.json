|\n| \"Has [stakeholder] seen this?\" | Coverage |\n| \"What concerns might [stakeholder] have?\" | Objections |\n\n---\n\n## Red Flag Questions\n\nWhen clarity isn't improving:\n\n1. \"Why haven't you done this before?\"\n   - Reveals: hidden blockers\n\n2. \"What's stopped this from happening already?\"\n   - Reveals: organizational issues\n\n3. \"If I said yes to everything, what would you build?\"\n   - Reveals: scope creep risk\n\n4. \"What happens if we don't do this?\"\n   - Reveals: urgency/priority\n\n5. \"Who would push back on this scope?\"\n   - Reveals: political dynamics\n\n---\n\n## Question Sequencing\n\n### Discovery Meeting Flow\n\n1. **Open (5 min):** Broad problem questions\n2. **Narrow (15 min):** Specificity questions\n3. **Bound (10 min):** Scope
