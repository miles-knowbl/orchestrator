A skill that fails any quality gate is not ready for publishing.\n\n## Required Deliverables\n\n| Deliverable | Location | Condition |\n|-------------|----------|-----------|\n| `SKILL.md` | `skills/{name}/` | Always --- the skill definition following the 13-section template |\n| Reference files | `skills/{name}/references/` | Always --- minimum 4 reference files, 80-150 lines each |\n| `VALIDATION.md` | Project root | When creating a new skill --- temporary artifact documenting validation results |\n\n## Core Concept\n\nSkill Design answers: **\"How do we build, maintain, and evolve a high-quality skill?\"**\n\nSkill Design is:\n- **The authoritative process for skill creation and governance** --- No skill enters the library without following this process\n- **Template-driven** --- Every skill follows the same 13-section structure, enabling automated indexing, search, and composition\n- **Quality-gated** --- Minimum standards are enforced before publishing; skeletal skills are upgraded, not shipped\n- **MECE-aware** --- Validates that skills are mutually exclusive (no significant overlap) and collectively exhaustive (all phases covered)\n- **Lifecycle-complete** --- Covers the full arc: create, improve, deprecate, demote, and consolidate\n- **Self-referential** --- This skill is itself a model of the template it describes\n\nSkill Design is NOT:\n- Content analysis (that is `content-analysis` --- extracting skills from content)\n- Documentation in general (that is `document` --- documenting code and systems)\n- Code scaffolding (that is `scaffold` --- creating project directory structures)\n- A one-time process --- Skills improve continuously through use and feedback\n- Style guidance --- This skill defines structure and quality gates, not prose style\n- Library infrastructure --- Indexing, serving, and API design are engineering concerns, not skill design concerns\n\n## The Skill Design Process\n\n```\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                       SKILL DESIGN PROCESS                             |\n|                                                                        |\n|  1.

If you find yourself writing \"and\" in the description more than once, the skill may be too broad. Split it.\n\n| Signal | Interpretation |\n|--------|----------------|\n| Description requires \"and\" twice | Likely two skills bundled |\n| Steps span multiple phases | Skill may be too broad |\n| Tags span unrelated domains | Scope is not focused |\n| IS NOT list exceeds 6 items | Skill is trying to be everything |\n| More than 3 depends_on | Skill may be a meta-workflow, not a skill |\n\n### Phase Assignment\n\nEvery skill belongs to exactly one phase. Choose the phase where the skill's primary work occurs:\n\n| Phase | Purpose | Example Skills |\n|-------|---------|----------------|\n| INIT | Project setup, context gathering | `context-ingestion` |\n| SCAFFOLD | Structure creation, planning | `scaffold`, `context-cultivation`, `skill-design` |\n| IMPLEMENT | Building and coding | `implement` |\n| TEST | Test creation and execution | `test-generation` |\n| VERIFY | Code correctness checking | `code-verification` |\n| VALIDATE | Content and quality validation | `content-analysis` |\n| DOCUMENT | Documentation authoring | `document` |\n| REVIEW | Quality review and feedback | `code-review` |\n| SHIP | Deployment and release | `deploy` |\n| COMPLETE | Wrap-up and retrospective | `loop-controller` |\n\n### Boundary Definition\n\nExplicitly state what the skill covers and what it delegates:\n\n```markdown\n## Boundary Definition for [skill-name]\n\n**This skill covers:**\n- [Specific capability 1]\n- [Specific capability 2]\n- [Specific capability 3]\n\n**This skill delegates to:**\n- [other-skill]: [what it handles]\n- [other-skill]: [what it handles]\n\n**Gray areas (document the decision):**\n- [Topic X]: Handled here because [reason], not by [other-skill] because [reason]\n```\n\n### Category Selection\n\n| Category | Definition | Examples |\n|----------|-----------|----------|\n| **core** | Essential to the engineering loop; every project needs it | `implement`, `scaffold`, `test-generation` |\n| **meta** | Skills about the skill system itself | `skill-design`, `content-analysis` |\n| **specialized** | Domain-specific or situational skills | `context-cultivation`, `priority-matrix` |\n| **infra** | Infrastructure and platform skills | `deploy`, `error-handling` |\n| **custom** | Project-specific skills not in the shared library | Per-project overrides |\n\n### Tag Selection\n\nChoose 3-6 descriptive tags. Check existing skills to avoid duplicating tag sets:\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] Tags are lowercase, hyphenated\n- [ ] 3-6 tags selected\n- [ ] No tag set duplicates another skill's tags exactly\n- [ ] Tags reflect the skill's domain, not generic verbs\n- [ ] At least one tag is shared with a related skill (for discoverability)\n```\n\n### Dependency Declaration\n\nList skills in `depends_on` only if they MUST execute before this skill can run:\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] Every dependency is a real runtime prerequisite, not just a related skill\n- [ ] Dependency graph is acyclic (no circular references)\n- [ ] Prefer fewer dependencies; most skills should have 0-2\n```\n\n## Step 3: Template Scaffolding\n\nCreate the directory structure and populate the SKILL.md with the 13-section skeleton.\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n```\nskills/{name}/\n+-- SKILL.md\n+-- references/\n    +-- (reference files will go here)\n```\n\n### YAML Frontmatter Template\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: {name}\ndescription: \"{One sentence, 20-40 words, present tense, describes the capability}\"\nphase: {PHASE}\ncategory: {core|meta|specialized|infra|custom}\nversion: \"1.0.0\"\ndepends_on: [{list of skill names, or empty}]\ntags: [{3-6 lowercase hyphenated tags}]\n---\n```\n\n### Section Header Skeleton\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: {name}\ndescription: \"{description}\"\nphase: {PHASE}\ncategory: {category}\nversion: \"1.0.0\"\ndepends_on: []\ntags: [{tags}]\n---\n\n# {Title}\n\n{One-line description in imperative form.}\n\n## When to Use\n\n- **{Trigger 1}** --- {Explanation}\n- **{Trigger 2}** --- {Explanation}\n- **{Trigger 3}** --- {Explanation}\n- **{Trigger 4}** --- {Explanation}\n- When you say: \"{natural language triggers}\"\n\n## Reference Requirements\n\n**MUST read before applying this skill:**\n\n| Reference | Why Required |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| `{ref-1}.md` | {Why} |\n| `{ref-2}.md` | {Why} |\n\n**Read if applicable:**\n\n| Reference | When Needed |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| `{ref-3}.md` | {When} |\n\n**Verification:** {What must be true before marking complete.}\n\n## Required Deliverables\n\n| Deliverable | Location | Condition |\n|-------------|----------|-----------|\n| {Deliverable 1} | {Path} | {When} |\n\n## Core Concept\n\n{Skill Name} answers: **\"{Central question}\"**\n\n{Skill Name} is:\n- **{Characteristic 1}** --- {Explanation}\n- **{Characteristic 2}** --- {Explanation}\n\n{Skill Name} is NOT:\n- {Anti-characteristic 1} (that is `{other-skill}`)\n- {Anti-characteristic 2}\n\n## The {Skill Name} Process\n\n{ASCII box diagram}\n\n## Step 1: {Step Name}\n\n{Content}\n\n## Step N: {Step Name}\n\n{Content}\n\n## Output Formats\n\n### Quick Format\n\n{Template}\n\n### Full Format\n\n{Template}\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### {Pattern Name}\n\n{Description}\n\n**Use when:** {Conditions}\n\n## Relationship to Other Skills\n\n| Skill | Relationship |\n|-------|--------------|\n| `{skill}` | {Relationship} |\n\n## Key Principles\n\n**{Principle 1}.** {Explanation}\n\n**{Principle 2}.** {Explanation}\n\n## References\n\n- `references/{ref-1}.md`: {Description}\n- `references/{ref-2}.md`: {Description}\n```\n\n### Scaffolding Checklist\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] Directory created: skills/{name}/\n- [ ] Subdirectory created: skills/{name}/references/\n- [ ] SKILL.md created with frontmatter and all 13 section headers\n- [ ] Frontmatter fields validated (name, description, phase, category, version, depends_on, tags)\n- [ ] Ready for content authoring\n```\n\n## Step 4: Content Authoring\n\nThis is the bulk of skill creation. Each of the 13 sections has specific requirements for what it must contain, minimum depth, and common mistakes to avoid.\n\n### Section-by-Section Authoring Guide\n\n#### Section 1: Title + One-Line Description\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Format** | H1 heading matching the `name` field, followed by one sentence |\n| **Voice** | Imperative: \"Design...\", \"Generate...\", \"Analyze...\" |\n| **Length** | 5-15 words |\n| **Common mistake** | Describing what the skill is instead of what it does |\n\n#### Section 2: When to Use\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Format** | Bulleted list with **bold trigger** followed by em-dash explanation |\n| **Count** | 4-6 triggers minimum |\n| **Must include** | \"When you say:\" line with 3-5 natural language phrases |\n| **Common mistake** | Triggers too vague (\"when needed\") or too narrow (\"only for React projects\") |\n\nExample from `content-analysis`:\n```markdown\n- **Inbox item arrives** --- New content enters the second-brain pipeline and needs decomposition\n- When you say: \"analyze this content\", \"extract skills from\", \"find patterns in\"\n```\n\n#### Section 3: Reference Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Format** | Two tables: MUST read + Read if applicable |\n| **MUST table** | 2-3 references that are always required |\n| **If-applicable table** | 2-4 references needed in specific situations |\n| **Verification line** | One sentence: what must be true before the skill is complete |\n| **Common mistake** | Listing references without explaining why they are required |\n\n#### Section 4: Required Deliverables\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Format** | Table with Deliverable, Location, and Condition columns |\n| **Condition column** | \"Always\", \"When X\", or \"If Y\" --- not blank |\n| **Common mistake** | Omitting the Condition column or leaving it as \"Always\" for optional deliverables |\n\n#### Section 5: Core Concept\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Format** | \"answers: **question**\" followed by IS list and IS NOT list |\n| **IS list** | 4-6 items, each **bold** with em-dash explanation |\n| **IS NOT list** | 4-6 items, each naming the skill that handles the excluded concern |\n| **Common mistake** | IS NOT list that does not reference specific other skills |\n\n#### Section 6: Process Diagram\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Format** | ASCII box diagram showing all process steps |\n| **Content** | Step number, step name, one-line description of action |\n| **Common mistake** | Using Mermaid or other non-ASCII formats that do not render universally |\n\n#### Section 7: Steps (The Bulk --- 60%+ of Total Lines)\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Format** | Each step is an H2 heading: \"## Step N: Name\" |\n| **Minimum per step** | Introductory paragraph + at least one table, checklist, or code block |\n| **Tables** | Use for structured comparisons, decision matrices, classification schemes |\n| **Checklists** | Use for verification and completeness checking |\n| **Code blocks** | Use for templates, output formats, commands |\n| **Decision trees** | Use for branching logic (ASCII format) |\n| **Common mistake** | Steps that are only prose with no structured elements |\n\n#### Section 8: Output Formats\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Quick format** | Lightweight output for small or simple tasks |\n| **Full format** | Complete output for comprehensive tasks |\n| **Both must** | Include markdown code blocks showing the exact template |\n| **Common mistake** | Only providing one format, or formats that are too abstract to copy |\n\n#### Section 9: Common Patterns\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Count** | 3-4 named patterns |\n| **Each pattern** | H3 heading, paragraph description, \"**Use when:**\" line |\n| **Common mistake** | Patterns that are just restatements of the steps |\n\n#### Section 10: Relationship to Other Skills\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Format** | Table with Skill and Relationship columns |\n| **Count** | 4-8 related skills |\n| **Relationship text** | Specific: what this skill provides to or receives from the other |\n| **Common mistake** | Vague relationships like \"related to\" or \"works with\" |\n\n#### Section 11: Key Principles\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Count** | 5-6 principles |\n| **Format** | **Bold principle statement.** Followed by one-line explanation |\n| **Common mistake** | Principles that are too generic (\"write good code\") or not actionable |\n\n#### Section 12: References\n\n| Requirement | Detail |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Format** | Bulleted list: `references/{name}.md`: {one-line description} |\n| **Count** | Match the reference files created in Step 5 |\n| **Common mistake** | Listing references that do not exist, or forgetting to list created references |\n\n### Authoring Quality Heuristics\n\n| Heuristic | Target |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Total line count | 400-600 lines |\n| Tables per skill | 8-15 |\n| Code blocks per skill | 5-10 |\n| Checklists per skill | 3-6 |\n| ASCII diagrams per skill | 1-3 |\n| Prose paragraphs between structured elements | 1-3 paragraphs max before next table/block |\n\n## Step 5: Reference Authoring\n\nReference files provide the supporting detail that keeps the main SKILL.md scannable while ensuring the skill is self-contained.\n\n### Reference File Standards\n\n| Aspect | Requirement |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Length** | 80-150 lines per file |\n| **Count** | Minimum 4 reference files per skill |\n| **Focus** | Each reference covers exactly one aspect of the skill |\n| **Naming** | Lowercase-hyphenated: `quality-checklist.md`, `lifecycle-management.md` |\n| **Usability** | Must be immediately useful during skill execution, not background reading |\n\n### Reference File Structure\n\n```markdown\n# {Reference Title}\n\n{One paragraph introduction: what this reference covers and when to use it.}\n\n## {Section 1}\n\n{Content with tables, lists, and examples.}\n\n## {Section 2}\n\n{Content with tables, lists, and examples.}\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n{Summary table or checklist for fast lookup during execution.}\n```\n\n### Reference Authoring Checklist\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] At least 4 reference files created\n- [ ] Each file is 80-150 lines\n- [ ] Each file covers a single focused topic\n- [ ] Files use lowercase-hyphenated naming\n- [ ] Files contain tables, lists, or structured data (not just prose)\n- [ ] Files are useful during execution, not just background context\n- [ ] All references listed in SKILL.md Section 12 match actual files\n- [ ] SKILL.md Section 3 tables reference the correct filenames\n```\n\n### Minimum Reference Set for Any Skill\n\nEvery skill should have at minimum:\n\n| Reference Type | Purpose | Example Filename |\n|----------------|---------|------------------|\n| **Primary process guide** | Deep detail on the skill's main process | `analysis-framework.md` |\n| **Quality criteria** | Standards and checklists for the skill's output | `quality-checklist.md` |\n| **Templates/formats** | Reusable templates for the skill's deliverables | `output-templates.md` |\n| **Decision guidance** | Decision trees and heuristics for judgment calls | `decision-guide.md` |\n\n## Step 6: MECE Validation\n\nMECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) validation ensures the skill library as a whole remains clean: no duplicate skills, no gaps in coverage.\n\n### Overlap Check\n\nFor the new skill, compare against all existing skills:\n\n```markdown\n## Overlap Analysis: {new-skill} vs Existing Skills\n\n| Existing Skill | Shared Tags | Jaccard Score | Verdict |\n|----------------|-------------|---------------|---------|\n| {skill-1} | {tags} | {0.XX} | {distinct / investigate / duplicate} |\n| {skill-2} | {tags} | {0.XX} | {distinct / investigate / duplicate} |\n```\n\n### Jaccard Thresholds\n\n| Score | Interpretation | Action |\n|-------|----------------|--------|\n| < 0.20 | Clearly distinct | No concern |\n| 0.20 - 0.39 | Minor overlap | Document the boundary |\n| 0.40 - 0.59 | Significant overlap | Investigate: should one be a reference under the other? |\n| 0.60 - 0.79 | Likely duplicate | Merge or clearly differentiate scope |\n| >= 0.80 | Almost certainly duplicate | Do not create; enhance existing skill instead |\n\n### Phase Coverage Check\n\nAfter adding the new skill, verify phase coverage:\n\n```markdown\n## Phase Coverage\n\n| Phase | Skills | Coverage |\n|-------|--------|----------|\n| INIT | {list} | {adequate / gap} |\n| SCAFFOLD | {list} | {adequate / gap} |\n| IMPLEMENT | {list} | {adequate / gap} |\n| TEST | {list} | {adequate / gap} |\n| VERIFY | {list} | {adequate / gap} |\n| VALIDATE | {list} | {adequate / gap} |\n| DOCUMENT | {list} | {adequate / gap} |\n| REVIEW | {list} | {adequate / gap} |\n| SHIP | {list} | {adequate / gap} |\n| COMPLETE | {list} | {adequate / gap} |\n```\n\n### Dependency Graph Validation\n\nThe skill dependency graph must be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). No circular dependencies.\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] New skill's depends_on does not create a cycle\n- [ ] No skill transitively depends on itself\n- [ ] Dependency chain length is <= 3 (prefer shallow graphs)\n```\n\n### Coverage Analysis API\n\nAfter adding the skill, verify via the skills library API:\n\n```bash\n# Check coverage across phases\nGET /api/skills-coverage\n\n# Check dependency graph for cycles\nGET /api/skills-graph\n\n# Verify the new skill appears correctly\nGET /api/skills/{name}?includeReferences=true\n```\n\n## Step 7: Quality Review\n\nApply the quality checklist to every skill before publishing. No exceptions.\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\n```markdown\n## Skill Quality Review: {skill-name}\n\n### Structure (all required)\n- [ ] All 13 sections present\n- [ ] Sections appear in the correct order\n- [ ] YAML frontmatter is valid and complete\n- [ ] Title matches the `name` field\n\n### Depth (minimum thresholds)\n- [ ] Total line count >= 300 (target: 400-600)\n- [ ] At least 4 reference files\n- [ ] Steps section comprises 60%+ of total lines\n- [ ] Each step has at least one table, checklist, or code block\n\n### Content Quality\n- [ ] No placeholder content (\"TODO\", \"TBD\", \"[fill in]\", \"...\")\n- [ ] Code examples are syntactically valid\n- [ ] Tables have header rows and consistent columns\n- [ ] ASCII diagrams render correctly in fixed-width fonts\n- [ ] Checklists use `- [ ]` format\n\n### Consistency\n- [ ] Em-dash separator is `---` (three hyphens), used consistently\n- [ ] Bold formatting uses `**text**`, not `__text__`\n- [ ] Skill references use backtick-quoted names: `skill-name`\n- [ ] Reference file names match actual files in `references/`\n\n### Completeness\n- [ ] When to Use has 4-6 triggers plus natural language line\n- [ ] Core Concept has IS list (4-6) and IS NOT list (4-6)\n- [ ] Common Patterns has 3-4 named patterns\n- [ ] Relationship table has 4-8 entries\n- [ ] Key Principles has 5-6 principles\n\n### MECE\n- [ ] Overlap analysis completed against existing skills\n- [ ] Jaccard scores documented for closest matches\n- [ ] No score >= 0.60 without explicit scope differentiation\n- [ ] Phase coverage maintained or improved\n```\n\n### Quality Grades\n\n| Grade | Criteria | Action |\n|-------|----------|--------|\n| **Publishable** | All checklist items pass | Proceed to Step 8 |\n| **Needs polish** | 1-3 minor items fail | Fix and re-review |\n| **Needs rework** | 4+ items fail or any structural issue | Return to Step 4 |\n| **Not viable** | Fundamental scope or overlap issue | Return to Step 1 |\n\n## Step 8: Publishing\n\nOnce a skill passes quality review, publish it to the skills library.\n\n### Publishing Steps\n\n1. **Place the skill** in the `skills/` directory:\n   ```\n   skills/{name}/\n   +-- SKILL.md\n   +-- references/\n       +-- {ref-1}.md\n       +-- {ref-2}.md\n       +-- {ref-3}.md\n       +-- {ref-4}.md\n   ```\n\n2. **Server auto-indexes** on restart or file watch. No manual registration required.\n\n3. **Verify via API:**\n   ```bash\n   # Skill is indexed and returns full content\n   GET /api/skills/{name}?includeReferences=true\n\n   # Skill appears in coverage report\n   GET /api/skills-coverage\n\n   # Skill appears in dependency graph\n   GET /api/skills-graph\n\n   # Skill is searchable by tags and description\n   GET /api/skills?search={keywords}\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify via MCP:**\n   ```\n   mcp__skills-library__get_skill({ name: \"{name}\", includeReferences: true })\n   ```\n\n5. **Announce:** The skill is available for use. Downstream skills that reference it can now declare it in `depends_on`.\n\n### Post-Publishing Checklist\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] SKILL.md and all references are in skills/{name}/\n- [ ] API returns the skill with full content and references\n- [ ] Skill appears in coverage report under correct phase\n- [ ] Dependency graph has no cycles\n- [ ] Search returns the skill for relevant keywords\n- [ ] VALIDATION.md (if created) has been cleaned up from project root\n```\n\n## Output Formats\n\n### Quick Format (Scaffold Only)\n\nWhen you only need to create the skeleton for later authoring:\n\n```markdown\nskills/{name}/\n+-- SKILL.md (frontmatter + 13 section headers, no content)\n+-- references/\n```\n\nProduces a SKILL.md of approximately 60-80 lines with the frontmatter and every section header as a placeholder. Content authoring follows separately.\n\n### Full Format (Complete Skill)\n\nWhen delivering a fully authored, publication-ready skill:\n\n```markdown\nskills/{name}/\n+-- SKILL.md (all 13 sections, 400-600 lines)\n+-- references/\n    +-- {ref-1}.md (80-150 lines)\n    +-- {ref-2}.md (80-150 lines)\n    +-- {ref-3}.md (80-150 lines)\n    +-- {ref-4}.md (80-150 lines)\n```\n\n### Validation Report Template\n\nWhen creating a new skill, produce a temporary VALIDATION.md:\n\n```markdown\n# Skill Validation Report: {skill-name}\n\n**Date:** {date}\n**Author:** {author}\n**Phase:** {phase}\n**Category:** {category}\n\n## Need Assessment\n- **Decision:** Create standalone / Enhance existing / Add reference\n- **Closest existing skill:** {name} (Jaccard: {score})\n- **Justification:** {Why a new skill is needed}\n\n## Scope\n- **Single responsibility:** {One sentence}\n- **Phase:** {phase}\n- **Category:** {category}\n- **Tags:** {list}\n- **depends_on:** {list}\n\n## Quality Checklist Results\n- Structure: {PASS / FAIL with details}\n- Depth: {PASS / FAIL with details}\n- Content Quality: {PASS / FAIL with details}\n- Consistency: {PASS / FAIL with details}\n- Completeness: {PASS / FAIL with details}\n- MECE: {PASS / FAIL with details}\n\n## MECE Analysis\n| Existing Skill | Jaccard | Verdict |\n|----------------|---------|---------|\n| {skill} | {score} | {verdict} |\n\n## Phase Coverage Impact\n- Before: {phases covered}\n- After: {phases covered}\n- Net change: {added / no change}\n\n## Verdict\n**{PUBLISH / NEEDS POLISH / NEEDS REWORK / NOT VIABLE}**\n\n## Notes\n{Any additional context or decisions}\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Greenfield Skill\n\nA completely new domain or capability with no existing skill overlap. Follow the full 8-step process from Need Assessment through Publishing. The skill fills a genuine gap in the library.\n\n**Use when:** An entirely new capability is needed, phase coverage has a gap, and no existing skill comes close (Jaccard < 0.20 against all existing skills).\n\n### Extraction-to-Skill\n\nThe inbox pipeline (via `content-analysis`) classifies content as a standalone skill candidate. The extraction (typically 50-80 lines) must be expanded to the full 13-section template (400-600 lines). The extraction provides the seed content; this pattern provides the expansion process.\n\n**Use when:** `content-analysis` produces a standalone skill classification with extraction confidence >= 0.7 and the need assessment confirms no existing skill covers the domain.\n\n### Promotion\n\nA reference document under a parent skill has grown substantial (exceeding 200 lines) or covers a capability that is clearly distinct from the parent. Promote it to its own skill directory with its own references. Update the parent skill to reference the new skill in its Relationship table.\n\n**Use when:** A reference file exceeds 200 lines, covers a distinct capability, and would benefit from having its own references and structured process.\n\n### Consolidation\n\nMultiple shallow or overlapping skills are merged into one comprehensive skill. The best content from each source skill is preserved. Original skills are demoted to references under the consolidated skill, or deprecated entirely. Coverage analysis confirms reduced overlap.\n\n**Use when:** Coverage analysis reveals two or more skills with Jaccard > 0.40 that would serve users better as a single comprehensive skill with references.\n\n## Relationship to Other Skills\n\n| Skill | Relationship |\n|-------|--------------|\n| `content-analysis` | Extracts candidate skills from content; skill-design validates and expands them to full template |\n| `context-ingestion` | Feeds raw content that may eventually become skills through the extraction pipeline |\n| `context-cultivation` | Cultivated insights inform scope decisions for new skills |\n| `document` | Shares documentation standards; skill-design applies them specifically to skill authoring |\n| `code-review` | Reviews code quality; skill-design reviews skill quality using analogous rigor |\n| `scaffold` | Scaffolds code projects; skill-design scaffolds skill directories and templates |\n| `loop-controller` | Manages the engineering loop lifecycle; skill-design manages the skill lifecycle |\n| `metadata-extraction` | Extracts structural metadata; skill-design defines the metadata schema (frontmatter) for skills |\n\n## Key Principles\n\n**Template consistency enables automation.** Every skill following the same 13-section structure means tools can parse, index, search, and compose them reliably. Deviating from the template breaks the toolchain.\n\n**Depth over breadth.** One 500-line skill with references beats five 50-line stubs. Depth makes skills self-contained and usable without external context. A shallow skill forces the user to search elsewhere for the details they need.\n\n**MECE is non-negotiable.** Skills must be mutually exclusive (no significant overlap) and collectively exhaustive (all phases covered). Run validation before publishing. Overlapping skills confuse both humans and automated selection.\n\n**References are first-class.** Supporting docs are not optional extras. They make skills self-contained and provide the detail that keeps the main SKILL.md scannable. A skill without references is incomplete.\n\n**Prefer enhancement over creation.** Before creating a new skill, check if the content belongs as a section or reference in an existing skill. The bar for a new standalone skill is high. The library benefits from fewer, deeper skills over many shallow ones.\n\n**Skills improve through use.** Every execution should feed back improvements via `capture_improvement`. The library is a living system, not a static archive. The best skills are the ones that have been used, critiqued, and refined.\n\n## References\n\n- `references/skill-template.md`: The complete 13-section template with authoring guidance for every section, field definitions, and examples\n- `references/quality-checklist.md`: Minimum quality criteria every skill must meet, organized by category with pass/fail thresholds\n- `references/mece-validation.md`: Procedures for checking skill overlap (Jaccard similarity), phase coverage, and dependency graph acyclicity\n- `references/lifecycle-management.md`: Versioning conventions, deprecation process, demotion workflow, and consolidation procedures\n- `references/extraction-integration.md`: How to convert inbox extractions from content-analysis into full skills using the 8-step process",

Does the extraction cover a multi-step process?\n   - **NO** -- Is it focused on one sub-topic? YES: `reference_doc`. NO: archive or discard.\n   - **YES** -- Does an existing skill cover this process?\n     - **NO** -- `standalone_skill`\n     - **YES** -- Does it add 3+ new patterns or steps? YES: `skill_enhancement`. NO: `reference_doc`\n\n## Expansion: Extraction to Full Skill (7 Steps)\n\n### Step 1: Review Extraction for Accuracy\nVerify claims are factual, scope is correct, no hallucinated content, key concepts identified.\n\n### Step 2: Run Need Assessment\n\n| Assessment | Question | Pass Criteria |\n|------------|----------|---------------|\n| Overlap check | Does an existing skill cover >40% of this? | Jaccard < 0.40 on tags |\n| Phase fit | Which phase does this belong to? | Clear assignment, not forced |\n| Workflow fit | Which loop would invoke this? | At least one concrete usage |\n| Depth potential | Can this support 400+ lines? | At least 5 distinct steps visible |\n\nIf need assessment fails, reclassify as `skill_enhancement` or `reference_doc`.\n\n### Step 3: Scaffold Template\nGenerate the 13-section SKILL.md skeleton (see `skill-template.md`). Fill frontmatter from extraction metadata. Leave section bodies empty.\n\n### Step 4: Expand Each Section\n\n| Section | Extraction Provides | Author Adds |\n|---------|--------------------|--------------|\n| When to Use | 1-2 triggers | 2-4 additional triggers, example phrases |\n| Core Concept | Key idea | IS/IS NOT framework, central question |\n| Steps | Process outline | Full tables, checklists, templates per step |\n| Common Patterns | 1-2 patterns | 2-3 additional patterns with triggers |\n| Key Principles | Implicit principles | 4-6 explicit, actionable principles |\n\n**Expansion ratio:** Each extraction line expands to ~5-8 lines. A 60-line extraction targets a 400-line skill.\n\n### Step 5: Author Reference Files\nCreate 4+ reference files (80-150 lines each): step support, pattern catalogs, template libraries, decision guides.\n\n### Step 6: MECE Validate\nRun full MECE validation (see `mece-validation.md`): tag Jaccard, DAG check, phase coverage, unique tags.\n\n### Step 7: Quality Review\nRun full quality checklist (see `quality-checklist.md`): 13 sections, 300+ lines, 60%+ steps, 4+ references.\n\n## Enhancement Process\n\nWhen classification is `skill_enhancement`:\n\n1. **Identify target** -- Which skill and which section(s) benefit?\n2. **Draft additions** -- Match the existing skill's style and format\n3. **Integrate** -- Add new patterns, steps, or expanded tables\n4. **Update references** -- Add a reference file if enhancement is substantial\n5. **Bump version** -- Minor for new sections/significant additions; Patch for clarifications\n\n| Size | Content Added | Version Impact |\n|------|---------------|----------------|\n| Small (< 20 lines) | Bullets, table rows, clarifications | Patch |\n| Medium (20-80 lines) | New pattern, expanded step, new examples | Minor |\n| Large (80+ lines) | New step, new reference file, restructured section | Minor or Major |\n\n## Reference File Addition\n\nWhen classification is `reference_doc`:\n\n1. Identify parent skill\n2. Name the file (kebab-case, descriptive of the topic)\n3. Write content (80-150 lines, one topic, tables and examples)\n4. Add to parent's Reference Requirements and References sections\n5. Bump parent version (minor)\n\n## Quality Comparison\n\n| Attribute | Extraction (~50 lines) | Full Skill (~500 lines) |\n|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Structure | Ad-hoc, varies by source | Template-driven, 13 sections |\n| Depth | Surface-level coverage | Deep guidance with examples |\n| References | None | 4+ supporting files |\n| Validation | None | Quality checklist + MECE |\n| Deliverables | Not defined | Explicit outputs with locations |\n| Boundaries | Implicit | Explicit IS/IS NOT with cross-refs |\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n| Pitfall | Prevention |\n|---------|------------|\n| **Premature promotion** -- treating extraction as finished skill | Always run the 7-step expansion |\n| **Wrong classification** -- narrow topic as standalone | Run decision tree; check overlap |\n| **Expansion bloat** -- padding to hit line counts | Focus on tables and templates, not prose |\n| **Orphan extraction** -- never classified or acted upon | Track all extractions to completion |\n| **Style mismatch** -- enhancement breaks parent format | Read parent skill before writing |\n"

Identify the parent skill to absorb content\n2. Copy SKILL.md body to `parent/references/demoted-name.md`\n3. Edit to reference format (80-150 lines, focused)\n4. Add reference to parent's Reference Requirements and References\n5. Delete the demoted skill directory\n6. Update VERSION.json\n\n## Archive Process\n1. Verify no skill depends on this one\n2. Verify no loop or workflow references it\n3. Move directory to `skills/_archive/skill-name/`\n4. Update VERSION.json\n5.

      "content": "# MECE Validation\n\nProcess for ensuring the skills library remains Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive. Run when adding or significantly restructuring a skill.\n\n## What MECE Means for Skills\n\n- **Mutually Exclusive:** Each skill has a distinct scope. No two skills teach the same process or produce the same deliverables. Tag overlap below 40%.\n- **Collectively Exhaustive:** The full library covers all phases. No critical capability is missing.\n\n## Overlap Detection\n\n### Tag-Based Jaccard Similarity\n\n```\nJaccard(A, B) = |A intersection B| / |A union B|\n```\n\n| Jaccard Score | Interpretation | Action |\n|---------------|---------------|--------|\n| 0.00 - 0.20 | No meaningful overlap | Proceed |\n| 0.21 - 0.40 | Minor overlap | Proceed; verify descriptions are distinct |\n| 0.41 - 0.60 | Significant overlap | Compare steps and deliverables manually |\n| 0.61 - 1.00 | Likely duplicate | Merge, demote to reference, or redefine scope |\n\n**Example:** Tags `[testing, quality, validation, automation]` vs `[testing, quality, coverage, unit-tests]`. Intersection: 2, Union: 6, Jaccard: 0.33 -- minor overlap, acceptable.\n\n### Description Semantic Similarity\n\nManual check when Jaccard is 0.21-0.60:\n\n| Check | Question | Red Flag |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| Verb overlap | Same starting verb? | Both say \"Validate...\" |\n| Object overlap | Same artifact? | Both mention \"code quality\" |\n| Outcome overlap | Similar deliverables? | Both output a checklist |\n| Actor overlap | Same trigger scenario? | Both triggered by \"before shipping\" |\n\nIf 3+ of 4 checks show overlap, merge or redraw boundaries.\n\n### Step Content Overlap\n\nCompare step names side by side. If more than 2 steps overlap in purpose, the skills are too similar. List steps from both skills, identify matches, and investigate any with 2+ shared step purposes.\n\n## Dependency Graph Rules\n\nThe `depends_on` relationships must form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n\n| Rule | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| No self-dependency | A skill cannot list itself in `depends_on` |\n| No circular chains | Following dependencies must never revisit a node |\n| Depth limit | Chains should not exceed 5 levels |\n| Orphans acceptable | No dependencies and no dependents is valid; document justification |\n\n### Cycle Detection\nWalk from each skill through its `depends_on` chain. If any path revisits a node, a cycle exists and must be resolved by removing or restructuring a dependency.\n\n## Phase Coverage\n\nAll 10 phases should have at least one skill. Current assignments:\n\n| Phase | Skills | Count |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| INIT | spec, architect, context-ingestion, context-cultivation, priority-matrix | 5 |\n| SCAFFOLD | scaffold, proposal-builder | 2 |\n| IMPLEMENT | implement, error-handling | 2 |\n| TEST | test-generation | 1 |\n| VERIFY | code-verification | 1 |\n| VALIDATE | (none) | 0 |\n| DOCUMENT | document | 1 |\n| REVIEW | code-review | 1 |\n| SHIP | deploy | 1 |\n| COMPLETE | (none) | 0 |\n| META | loop-controller, content-analysis, metadata-extraction | 3 |\n\n**Gaps:** VALIDATE and COMPLETE have no skills. When adding a skill, prefer underrepresented phases unless the skill clearly belongs elsewhere.\n\n## Tag Uniqueness\n\n| Rule | Rationale |\n|------|-----------|\n| No identical tag sets | Two skills with the same tags are likely redundant |\n| No pure subsets | If A's tags are a subset of B's, investigate overlap |\n| Limit shared tags | Tags used by 3+ skills should be replaced with more specific terms |\n| At least 1 unique tag | Each skill should have a tag no other skill shares |\n\n### Tag Quality\n\n| Good Tag | Bad Tag | Why |\n|----------|---------|-----|\n| `architecture-decisions` | `design` | Specific vs vague |\n| `source-evaluation` | `stuff` | Descriptive vs meaningless |\n| `unit-testing` | `testing` | Scoped vs too broad |\n\n## Validation Commands\n\n| MCP Tool | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| `list_skills` | Get all skills for comparison |\n| `get_skill` | Deep comparison of two skills |\n| `search_skills` | Find overlaps by keyword |\n| `validate_selection` | Verify dependencies are satisfiable |\n| `get_phases` | Check phase coverage |\n\n### Manual Review Process\n1. `list_skills` to get full roster\n2. Compute Jaccard for new skill against all existing tag sets\n3. For scores > 0.40, `get_skill` on both and compare\n4. `get_phases` to check coverage\n5. Verify dependency graph has no cycles\n6.

Organized by category with pass/fail criteria.\n\n## Structure Checklist\n\n| # | Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Example |\n|---|-------|---------------|--------------|\n| S1 | All 13 sections present | Every section from the template exists | Missing \"Common Patterns\" section |\n| S2 | Correct section order | Sections follow template order exactly | \"Key Principles\" before \"Steps\" |\n| S3 | Proper heading levels | `#` for title, `##` for sections, `###` for subsections | Using `###` for a main section |\n| S4 | YAML frontmatter valid | Opens and closes with `---`, all fields present | Missing `tags` field |\n| S5 | Title matches frontmatter | `# Name` matches `name:` field (human-readable form) | Frontmatter says `context-ingestion`, title says `Ingestion` |\n| S6 | Steps match process diagram | Numbered steps in diagram correspond to `## Step N` sections | Diagram shows 8 steps but only 6 step sections exist |\n| S7 | References section matches files | Every file in References exists in `references/` directory | Lists `analysis-guide.md` but file does not exist |\n\n**Verdict:** All 7 checks must pass. Any failure requires revision.\n\n## Depth Checklist\n\n| # | Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Example |\n|---|-------|---------------|--------------|\n| D1 | Minimum 300 lines | Total SKILL.md line count >= 300 | 180-line skill with thin steps |\n| D2 | Target 400-600 lines | Ideal range for comprehensive coverage | 250 lines (needs expansion) |\n| D3 | Steps are 60%+ of content | Steps sections collectively dominate | Steps are 90 lines in a 300-line skill (30%) |\n| D4 | Each step has substance | Every step has at least one table, checklist, or template | Step 3 is two paragraphs with no structured content |\n| D5 | No single-paragraph steps | Steps must have subsections or structured elements | `## Step 4: Validate` followed by one paragraph |\n| D6 | Process diagram present | ASCII box diagram shows the full workflow | Diagram replaced with a bullet list |\n| D7 | Output formats include templates | Both quick and full formats have markdown templates | \"Use the standard output format\" with no template |\n\n**Verdict:** D1 is hard fail. D2 is advisory. D3-D7 must all pass.\n\n## References Checklist\n\n| # | Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Example |\n|---|-------|---------------|--------------|\n| R1 | At least 4 reference files | `references/` directory contains >= 4 `.md` files | Only 2 reference files |\n| R2 | Each file 80-150 lines | Line count per reference in range | 40-line stub reference |\n| R3 | References are focused | Each file covers one specific topic | `everything-guide.md` covering 5 topics |\n| R4 | Reference Requirements table complete | MUST-read and conditional references listed | Only MUST-read, no conditional |\n| R5 | No orphan references | Every file in `references/` is mentioned in SKILL.md | `deprecated-guide.md` exists but is not referenced |\n| R6 | References support steps | At least 2 references are cited from within step content | References only listed at bottom, never cited in steps |\n\n**Verdict:** R1 and R2 are hard fail. R3-R6 must all pass.\n\n## Content Checklist\n\n| # | Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Example |\n|---|-------|---------------|--------------|\n| C1 | No placeholders | No `[TODO]`, `[TBD]`, `[PLACEHOLDER]`, `[...]` | `## Step 5: [TBD]` |\n| C2 | No empty sections | Every section has substantive content | `## Common Patterns` followed by nothing |\n| C3 | Core Concept has IS/IS NOT | Both positive and negative identity defined | Only IS statements, no IS NOT |\n| C4 | IS NOT references other skills | Each boundary names the responsible skill | \"This is not analysis\" without naming which skill does analysis |\n| C5 | When to Use has 4+ triggers | At least 4 bold-label trigger bullets | Only 2 trigger conditions |\n| C6 | Key Principles are actionable | Principles give concrete guidance | \"Quality matters\" (platitude, not actionable) |\n| C7 | Relationship table has 4+ entries | Upstream, downstream, and lateral skills mapped | Only 2 relationships listed |\n| C8 | Deliverables table complete | Every deliverable has location and condition | Missing condition column |\n\n**Verdict:** All 8 checks must pass.\n\n## Formatting Checklist\n\n| # | Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Example |\n|---|-------|---------------|--------------|\n| F1 | Tables for structured data | Comparisons, matrices, and field lists use tables | Long bullet list that should be a table |\n| F2 | ASCII diagrams for processes | Workflow and architecture use box diagrams | Process described only in prose |\n| F3 | Code blocks for templates | Output templates and examples use fenced blocks | Templates in plain text without fencing |\n| F4 | Consistent separators | Double-dash `--` for descriptions in bullets | Mixing `--`, `-`, `:`, and `|` as separators |\n| F5 | Backtick-quoted skill names | Skill names use backticks in prose and tables | Plain text `context-ingestion` without backticks |\n| F6 | Bold labels in lists | Bullet points use `**Label**` before explanation | Bullets without bold label prefix |\n| F7 | No raw URLs | Links are descriptive, not bare URLs | `See https://example.com` |\n\n**Verdict:** F1-F3 are hard fail. F4-F7 are advisory but should be fixed.\n\n## Frontmatter Checklist\n\n| # | Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Example |\n|---|-------|---------------|--------------|\n| FM1 | name is kebab-case | Matches `[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*` | `skillDesign` or `Skill_Design` |\n| FM2 | name matches directory | `name` field equals the skill's directory name | Directory is `skill-design/`, name is `design` |\n| FM3 | description is 15-30 words | Word count in range, starts with verb | 8-word description or 50-word description |\n| FM4 | phase is valid | One of the 10 defined phases or META | `phase: PLANNING` (not a valid phase) |\n| FM5 | category is valid | One of: core, infra, meta, specialized, custom | `category: utility` |\n| FM6 | version is quoted semver | Matches `\"X.Y.Z\"` pattern | `version: 1.0` (unquoted, missing patch) |\n| FM7 | tags are 3-6 items | Array length in range, descriptive | 1 tag or 10 tags |\n| FM8 | depends_on lists real skills | Every dependency exists in the skills library | `depends_on: [requirements]` when no `requirements` skill exists |\n\n**Verdict:** All 8 checks must pass.\n\n## MECE Checklist\n\n| # | Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Example |\n|---|-------|---------------|--------------|\n| M1 | Tag Jaccard < 40% | No existing skill shares > 40% of tags | New skill tags overlap 60% with `implement` |\n| M2 | Description is distinct | Description does not paraphrase another skill | \"Implements features\" when `implement` exists |\n| M3 | Steps teach unique process | Steps do not duplicate another skill's process | Steps 1-5 mirror `code-review` steps |\n| M4 | Phase assignment justified | Skill fits its phase's purpose | Data analysis skill assigned to SHIP phase |\n| M5 | Not better as a reference | Skill is broad enough for standalone status | 150-line skill covering one narrow sub-topic |\n\n**Verdict:** M1-M4 must pass. M5 is advisory but may trigger demotion.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### Shallow Skill\n- **Symptom:** Under 200 lines, steps are 1-2 paragraphs each, no tables or templates\n- **Cause:** Rushed authoring or insufficient domain understanding\n- **Fix:** Expand each step with structured content; add concrete examples and checklists\n\n### Template Stub\n- **Symptom:** All 13 sections present but most contain placeholder text or minimal content\n- **Cause:** Template was filled in mechanically without real thought\n- **Fix:** Rewrite from scratch using the skill's actual domain knowledge; delete and restart\n\n### Copy-Paste Without Adaptation\n- **Symptom:** Steps, tables, or templates are copied from another skill with minimal changes\n- **Cause:** Author used an existing skill as a starting point but did not adapt\n- **Fix:** Identify what is unique about this skill and rewrite borrowed content to reflect its specific process\n\n### Missing Boundaries\n- **Symptom:** Core Concept has IS statements but no IS NOT, or IS NOT entries lack skill references\n- **Cause:** Author did not think about where this skill ends and others begin\n- **Fix:** Map adjacent skills and explicitly draw boundaries with cross-references\n\n### Reference Desert\n- **Symptom:** SKILL.md references section is present but `references/` directory has 0-1 files\n- **Cause:** References were planned but never authored\n- **Fix:** Author reference files before marking the skill as complete; each 80-150 lines\n\n## Scoring Rubric\n\n| Category | Weight | Pass/Fail |\n|----------|--------|-----------|\n| Structure | Required | All 7 checks pass |\n| Depth | Required | D1 passes; D3-D7 pass |\n| References | Required | R1, R2 pass; R3-R6 pass |\n| Content | Required | All 8 checks pass |\n| Formatting | Required | F1-F3 pass; F4-F7 advisory |\n| Frontmatter | Required | All 8 checks pass |\n| MECE | Required | M1-M4 pass; M5 advisory |\n\n### Overall Verdict\n\n- **PASS:** All required checks in all categories pass\n- **CONDITIONAL PASS:** All required checks pass but 2+ advisory items flagged (fix before next version)\n- **FAIL:** Any required check fails (must revise and re-review)\n\nA skill that fails any single required check is not ready for the library. Fix the failing checks and re-run the full checklist.\n"

      "content": "# SKILL.md Template\n\nComplete 13-section template for authoring a skill definition. Every skill MUST follow this exact section order.\n\n## YAML Frontmatter\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: skill-name           # kebab-case, must match directory name\ndescription: \"One-sentence  # 15-30 words, starts with verb\n  summary of the skill.\"\nphase: INIT                # INIT|SCAFFOLD|IMPLEMENT|TEST|VERIFY|VALIDATE|DOCUMENT|REVIEW|SHIP|COMPLETE\ncategory: core             # core|infra|meta|specialized|custom\nversion: \"1.0.0\"           # Quoted semver string\ndepends_on: []             # Array of skill names; empty if none\ntags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]   # 3-6 descriptive tags, unique set per skill\n---\n```\n\n| Field | Required | Rules |\n|-------|----------|-------|\n| `name` | Yes | kebab-case, matches directory name exactly |\n| `description` | Yes | 15-30 words, starts with a verb, no jargon |\n| `phase` | Yes | One of the 10 defined phases |\n| `category` | Yes | core, infra, meta, specialized, or custom |\n| `version` | Yes | Quoted semver (e.g., \"1.0.0\") |\n| `depends_on` | Yes | Array of skill names; empty array if none |\n| `tags` | Yes | 3-6 tags; no two skills should share the same tag set |\n\n## Section Order and Guidance\n\n### 1. Title\n`# Skill Name` followed by the frontmatter description verbatim. Capitalized, no hyphens.\n\n### 2. When to Use (min 4 triggers)\nBold-label bullets with double-dash separator. End with `When you say:` line listing 2-3 example phrases.\n\n### 3. Reference Requirements\nTwo tables: **MUST read** (`| Reference | Why Required |`) and **Read if applicable** (`| Reference | When Needed |`). Minimum 2 entries each. End with a **Verification** sentence.\n\n### 4. Required Deliverables\nTable: `| Deliverable | Location | Condition |`. At least 1 deliverable. Use \"Always\" or a specific condition.\n\n### 5. Core Concept\nCentral question in bold: `**\"What question does this skill answer?\"**`. Then 3-5 **IS** statements (bold label + practical meaning) and 3-5 **IS NOT** statements referencing the responsible skill: `(that is \\`other-skill\\`)`.\n\nExample:\n```markdown\nSkill Name is NOT:\n- Detailed implementation (that is `implement`)\n- Requirements gathering (that is `spec`)\n```\n\n### 6. Process Diagram\nASCII box diagram with numbered steps matching the Step sections. Use `+->` arrows.\n\n### 7. Steps (60%+ of total content)\nEach step is a `## Step N: Name` heading with: opening paragraph, at least one table/checklist/template, concrete guidance, and reference cross-links (`> See references/filename.md`). Steps are the heart of the skill -- allocate 60%+ of total line count here.\n\n### 8. Output Formats\nAt least two formats: Quick (simple cases) and Full (complex cases). Include actual markdown templates inside fenced code blocks, not just descriptions.\n\n### 9. Common Patterns\n3-4 named patterns with description and `**Use when:**` trigger line.\n\n### 10. Relationship to Other Skills\nTable: `| Skill | Relationship |`. Minimum 4-6 entries covering upstream, downstream, and parallel skills. Backtick-quote skill names.\n\n### 11. Key Principles\n4-6 principles. Format: `**Bold principle.** Explanation.` Actionable, not platitudes.\n\n### 12. References\nBullet list: `- \\`references/filename.md\\`: Description`. Minimum 4 entries. Every listed file must exist in the `references/` directory.\n\n## Content Requirements Summary\n\n| Section | Min Lines | Must Include |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|\n| Frontmatter | 8 | All 7 fields |\n| Title | 2 | Name + description |\n| When to Use | 6 | 4+ triggers + example phrases |\n| Reference Requirements | 12 | 2 MUST + 2 conditional + verification |\n| Required Deliverables | 5 | 1+ deliverable with location |\n| Core Concept | 15 | Central question + IS + IS NOT |\n| Process Diagram | 12 | ASCII diagram matching steps |\n| Steps | 60%+ | Tables, checklists, templates per step |\n| Output Formats | 15 | Quick + Full format templates |\n| Common Patterns | 15 | 3+ named patterns with triggers |\n| Relationships | 8 | 4+ skill relationships |\n| Key Principles | 10 | 4+ actionable principles |\n| References | 6 | 4+ reference file listings |\n\n**Total minimum:** 300 lines. **Target:** 400-600 lines.
