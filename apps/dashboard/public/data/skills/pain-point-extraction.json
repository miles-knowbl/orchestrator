Uncommon | Medium | 5 |\n| security | Uncommon | Medium | 5 |\n\n## Multi-Category Pain\n\nSome pain points span multiple categories:\n\n| Combined Pain | Categories |\n|---------------|------------|\n| \"Slow responses costing us customers\" | speed + experience + cost |\n| \"Can't hire fast enough to handle volume\" | talent + volume |\n| \"Manual processes causing errors\" | integration + quality |\n| \"Old system can't scale\" | legacy + volume |\n\nWhen pain spans categories, pick the **primary** category (most emphasized) and note **secondary** categories.\n"

      "content": "# Severity Scoring Reference\n\nHow to assess pain point severity.\n\n## Severity Levels\n\n### High Severity\n\n**Definition:** Critical problem that demands immediate attention.\n\n**Indicators:**\n- Executive-level concern (CEO, CFO, VP mentioned it)\n- Quantified, significant impact (300% increase, $2M cost)\n- Urgent language (\"critical\", \"drowning\", \"must fix\")\n- Mentioned multiple times (3+ mentions)\n- Has deadline attached (\"by Q2 or else\")\n- Affects revenue or customer retention\n- Board or investor pressure\n\n**Scoring Threshold:** 3+ indicators = High\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Our CEO is asking about this weekly\" → Executive concern\n- \"Ticket volume up 300%, team at breaking point\" → Quantified + urgent\n- \"If we don't fix this by June, we'll lose our biggest customer\" → Deadline + revenue\n\n---\n\n### Medium Severity\n\n**Definition:** Acknowledged problem that needs addressing but isn't urgent.\n\n**Indicators:**\n- Department-level concern (Director, Manager)\n- Some quantification but moderate impact\n- Acknowledged problem, not crisis\n- Mentioned 2 times\n- Would be nice to fix\n- Affects efficiency, not survival\n\n**Scoring Threshold:** 1-2 indicators from High, or pattern of Medium indicators\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Our support team struggles with this\" → Department concern\n- \"Response times have slipped a bit\" → Acknowledged, not urgent\n- \"We'd like to improve this area\" → Nice to have\n\n---\n\n### Low Severity\n\n**Definition:** Minor concern, mentioned in passing, not a priority.\n\n**Indicators:**\n- Individual contributor mentioned it\n- No quantification\n- Mentioned once, in passing\n- \"Someday\" language\n- Doesn't affect core operations\n- No stakeholder pressure\n\n**Scoring Threshold:** Few or no severity indicators\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"It would be cool if we could also...\" → Nice to have\n- \"Some people have mentioned...\" → Passing mention\n- \"Maybe eventually we'd want to...\" → Someday\n\n---\n\n## Severity Scoring Matrix\n\n| Factor | High | Medium | Low |\n|--------|------|--------|-----|\n| **Who mentioned** | Executive | Director/Manager | Individual |\n| **Quantified impact** | Significant ($1M+, 200%+) | Moderate | None |\n| **Language** | Urgent, critical | Acknowledged | Passing |\n| **Mention count** | 3+ times | 2 times | 1 time |\n| **Timeline** | Has deadline | General timeline | No timeline |\n| **Business impact** | Revenue/customers | Efficiency | Minor |\n\n## Scoring Process\n\n### Step 1: Count Indicators\n\nFor each pain point, check each factor:\n\n```\nPain: \"Support ticket volume up 300%, CEO asking weekly\"\n\n✓ Executive mentioned (CEO) → High indicator\n✓ Quantified (300%) → High indicator\n✓ Implied urgency (asking weekly) → High indicator\n□ Mention count: Check sources\n□ Timeline: Not mentioned\n□ Business impact: Implied (CEO attention)\n\nResult: 3+ High indicators → HIGH SEVERITY\n```\n\n### Step 2: Verify with Context\n\nCross-check against deal context:\n- Is this pain related to their buying motivation?\n- Would solving this make the deal happen?\n- Does the champion emphasize this?\n\n### Step 3: Assign and Document\n\n```json\n{\n  \"severity\": \"high\",\n  \"severityReason\": \"Executive-level concern (CEO asking weekly), quantified impact (300% increase), implied urgency\"\n}\n```\n\n## Severity Changes Over Time\n\nPain severity can change:\n\n| Change | Likely Cause |\n|--------|--------------|\n| Low → High | New information, escalation, deadline added |\n| High → Medium | Partially addressed, urgency decreased |\n| High → Low | Solved another way, priority shifted |\n\n**Rule:** Re-assess severity when new communications parsed.\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n### Over-rating\n\n| Mistake | Correction |\n|---------|------------|\n| Any mention = High | Need multiple indicators |\n| Assuming urgency | Look for explicit urgency signals |\n| Technical = High | Technical ≠ business critical |\n\n### Under-rating\n\n| Mistake | Correction |\n|---------|------------|\n| No numbers = Low | Qualitative can still be high |\n| Not repeated = Low | One strong executive mention = High |\n| Polite language = Low | Some execs are understated |\n\n## Confidence in Severity Assessment\n\n| Confidence | When to Use |\n|------------|-------------|\n| High | Multiple clear indicators, explicit statements |\n| Medium | Some indicators, some inference |\n| Low | Limited data, mostly inference |\n\nAlways note confidence:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"severity\": \"high\",\n  \"severityConfidence\": \"medium\",\n  \"severityReason\": \"Quantified impact clear, executive concern inferred from meeting attendance\"\n}\n```\n"
