What's the forcing function?\n- **Notes flexibility** — Hard deadline vs. soft target\n\n## The Extraction Process\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│         BUDGET TIMELINE EXTRACTION PROCESS              │\n│                                                         │\n│  1.

      "content": "# Budget Signals Reference\n\nTypes of budget indicators and how to interpret them.\n\n## Explicit Budget Signals\n\n### Exact Amount\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- \"$200,000\"\n- \"Half a million dollars\"\n- \"1.2M\"\n- \"Two hundred thousand\"\n\n**Confidence:** High — they stated a number\n\n**Interpretation:** This is their budget. May be ceiling, target, or starting point depending on context.\n\n### Range\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- \"$200K-$400K\"\n- \"Between 100 and 200 thousand\"\n- \"In the 500K range\"\n- \"Around a quarter million, maybe up to 300\"\n\n**Confidence:** High — they stated a range\n\n**Interpretation:** Lower end is often the real budget, upper end is stretch.\n\n---\n\n## Indicator Budget Signals\n\n### Magnitude Indicator\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- \"Six figures\"\n- \"Seven figures\"\n- \"Significant investment\"\n- \"Substantial budget\"\n- \"Major initiative\"\n\n**Confidence:** Medium — indicates order of magnitude\n\n**Interpretation:**\n- \"Six figures\" = $100K-$999K (wide range)\n- \"Seven figures\" = $1M+\n- \"Significant\" = varies by company size\n\n### Company Size Proxy\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Company size: 500 employees, $50M revenue\n- Industry benchmarks available\n- Similar companies mentioned\n\n**Confidence:** Low — inference from proxy data\n\n**Interpretation:** Use industry benchmarks.

Quantify their pain points.\n\n---\n\n## Comparison Signals\n\n### Versus Current Costs\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- \"Costs less than hiring\"\n- \"Cheaper than our current solution\"\n- \"If it saves us [current cost]...\"\n\n**Confidence:** Low to Medium — relative, not absolute\n\n**Interpretation:** Understand their current costs to calibrate.\n\n### Versus Alternatives\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- \"[Competitor] quoted us $X\"\n- \"Other solutions we've seen are around...\"\n- \"Industry standard seems to be...\"\n\n**Confidence:** Medium — external reference point\n\n**Interpretation:** Competitive intelligence. Price accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## Budget Signal Matrix\n\n| Signal Type | Confidence | Next Step |\n|-------------|------------|-----------|\n| Exact amount, approved | High | Confirm fit, move to close |\n| Range, approved | High | Calibrate to their range |\n| Indicator only | Medium | Get more specific |\n| Needs approval | Medium | Help build business case |\n| Constrained | Medium | Prove ROI, creative pricing |\n| Comparison only | Low | Understand their baseline |\n| No signals | Low | More discovery needed |\n\n---\n\n## Budget Questions to Ask\n\nWhen budget unclear, probe with:\n\n1. \"What budget range are you working with?\"\n2. \"Has budget been allocated for this initiative?\"\n3. \"Who needs to approve the investment?\"\n4. \"What's your typical process for purchases like this?\"\n5. \"What other solutions have you evaluated and at what price points?\"\n\n## Budget Red Flags\n\n| Signal | What It Means |\n|--------|---------------|\n| Refuses to discuss budget | Not serious buyer or very early stage |\n| Budget much lower than solution | Likely not a fit |\n| \"Budget is flexible\" | May not be real budget holder |\n| Budget keeps changing | Decision process unclear |\n"

Prioritize.\n\n### Regulatory/Compliance\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- \"Compliance deadline in June\"\n- \"New regulation takes effect [date]\"\n- \"Audit is scheduled for [date]\"\n\n**Confidence:** High — external, immovable\n\n**Flexibility:** None — regulatory deadlines don't slip\n\n**Interpretation:** High urgency, often premium pricing acceptable.\n\n---\n\n## Soft Target Signals\n\n### Aspirational\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- \"Hoping for Q2\"\n- \"Would be nice to have by...\"\n- \"Targeting end of year\"\n- \"Goal is to be live by...\"\n\n**Confidence:** Medium — stated preference, not commitment\n\n**Flexibility:** Medium to High — could slip\n\n**Interpretation:** Real timeline may be later.

Can you help unblock it?\n\n### External Dependency\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- \"When our customer requires it\"\n- \"After the acquisition closes\"\n- \"Once the partnership is signed\"\n\n**Confidence:** Medium — external factor\n\n**Flexibility:** Unknown — outside their control\n\n**Interpretation:** Monitor the dependency. Adjust forecast accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## Urgency Signals\n\n### High Urgency\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- \"ASAP\"\n- \"Urgent\"\n- \"Critical\"\n- \"Yesterday\"\n- \"As fast as possible\"\n- \"Can't wait\"\n\n**Confidence:** High — explicit urgency\n\n**Flexibility:** Low — they want speed\n\n**Interpretation:** Fast-track the deal. May accept premium for speed.\n\n### Medium Urgency\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- \"Soon\"\n- \"In the next few months\"\n- \"Relatively quickly\"\n- \"This is a priority\"\n\n**Confidence:** Medium — some urgency\n\n**Flexibility:** Medium — can negotiate\n\n**Interpretation:** Standard deal timeline. Keep momentum.\n\n### Low Urgency\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- \"Someday\"\n- \"Eventually\"\n- \"When we get around to it\"\n- \"Nice to have\"\n- \"No rush\"\n- \"Exploring options\"\n\n**Confidence:** High — explicitly not urgent\n\n**Flexibility:** High — no pressure\n\n**Interpretation:** May not buy.
