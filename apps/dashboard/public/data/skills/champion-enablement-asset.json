Reviewed pain-points.json\n- [ ] Reviewed budget-timeline.json\n- [ ] Reviewed stakeholders.json\n- [ ] Checked recent communications for quotes\n- [ ] Identified key numbers mentioned\n\n### During Creation\n\n- [ ] Used their company name (not generic)\n- [ ] Included their specific pain points\n- [ ] Used their actual numbers\n- [ ] Referenced their timeline/deadline\n- [ ] Named relevant stakeholders\n- [ ] Used their language/terminology\n\n### Before Delivery\n\n- [ ] Verified numbers are accurate\n- [ ] Confirmed names are spelled correctly\n- [ ] Checked for any [placeholder] text\n- [ ] Ensured formatting is clean\n- [ ] Appropriate for audience\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n### Mistake: Using Industry Averages\n\n**Problem:** \"Industry average is $15/ticket\"\n**Better:** \"Your $12/ticket cost\" (their actual number)\n\n### Mistake: Generic Pain Points\n\n**Problem:** \"High ticket volume\"\n**Better:** \"300% increase in tickets since last year\" (their situation)\n\n### Mistake: Wrong Audience Level\n\n**Problem:** Technical details for CFO\n**Better:** Financial impact for CFO\n\n### Mistake: Missing Context\n\n**Problem:** \"ROI of 150%\"\n**Better:** \"ROI of 162% — enough to fund two additional hires\"\n\n### Mistake: Placeholder Text\n\n**Problem:** \"[Company Name]\" left in document\n**Better:** Always search for brackets before delivery\n\n---\n\n## Audience Adaptation\n\n### For Finance (CFO, FP&A)\n\n**Emphasize:**\n- ROI and payback\n- Cost reduction\n- Budget impact\n- Risk mitigation\n\n**Use:**\n- Tables and numbers\n- Conservative estimates\n- Comparison to alternatives\n\n### For Technical (CTO, IT)\n\n**Emphasize:**\n- Architecture\n- Integration\n- Security\n- Scalability\n\n**Use:**\n- Diagrams\n- Technical specifics\n- Documentation references\n\n### For Operations (VP Ops, Director)\n\n**Emphasize:**\n- Process improvement\n- Efficiency gains\n- Team impact\n- Implementation\n\n**Use:**\n-

One-pagers\n- Key metrics\n- Visual summaries\n"
