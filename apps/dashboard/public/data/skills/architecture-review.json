      "content": "# Current State Mapping\n\nHow to document existing architecture accurately.\n\n## Why Current State Matters\n\nYou cannot assess what you don't understand. Current state mapping ensures:\n- You're reviewing what exists, not what was planned\n- All stakeholders share the same understanding\n- Gaps between documentation and reality are visible\n- Changes can be planned from an accurate baseline\n\n## Information Gathering\n\n### Source Priority\n\nPrioritize sources by reliability:\n\n| Priority | Source | Reliability | Notes |\n|----------|--------|-------------|-------|\n| 1 | Running code | High | Ground truth |\n| 2 | Infrastructure config | High | Actual deployment |\n| 3 | Monitoring/metrics | High | Actual behavior |\n| 4 | Recent git history | High | Recent changes |\n| 5 | Interviews (operators) | Medium | Current knowledge |\n| 6 | Interviews (developers) | Medium | May be outdated |\n| 7 | Documentation | Low | Often stale |\n| 8 | Old diagrams | Low | May not reflect reality |\n\n### What to Gather\n\n```markdown\n## Information Checklist\n\n### Code & Configuration\n- [ ] Repository structure\n- [ ] Dependency manifests (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)\n- [ ] Configuration files\n- [ ] Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)\n- [ ] Docker/container configurations\n- [ ] CI/CD pipeline definitions\n\n### Runtime Information\n- [ ] Deployed services list\n- [ ] Service endpoints and ports\n- [ ] Database schemas\n- [ ] Message queues/topics\n- [ ] Scheduled jobs/crons\n- [ ] Feature flags\n\n### Operational Data\n- [ ] Monitoring dashboards\n- [ ] Alert definitions\n- [ ] Recent incidents (last 6 months)\n- [ ] Performance metrics\n- [ ] Error rates and types\n- [ ] Traffic patterns\n\n### Documentation (verify accuracy)\n- [ ] Architecture diagrams\n- [ ] API documentation\n- [ ] Runbooks\n- [ ] ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)\n```\n\n## Mapping Techniques\n\n### 1. Dependency Analysis\n\nExtract actual dependencies from code:\n\n```bash\n# Node.js - list production dependencies\ncat package.json | jq '.dependencies'\n\n# Python - list installed packages\npip freeze\n\n# Find internal imports\ngrep -r \"import.*from\" src/ | grep -v node_modules\n\n# Find external API calls\ngrep -r \"fetch\\|axios\\|http\" src/ | grep -v node_modules\n```\n\n### 2. Infrastructure Discovery\n\n```bash\n# Kubernetes - list all resources\nkubectl get all --all-namespaces\n\n# Docker - list running containers\ndocker ps --format \"table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Image}}\\t{{.Ports}}\"\n\n# AWS - list EC2 instances\naws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value|[0],State.Name]'\n```\n\n### 3. Database Schema Extraction\n\n```sql\n-- PostgreSQL - list tables and columns\nSELECT table_name, column_name, data_type \nFROM information_schema.columns \nWHERE table_schema = 'public'\nORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;\n\n-- List foreign keys\nSELECT\n    tc.table_name, \n    kcu.column_name, \n    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,\n    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name \nFROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc \nJOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu\n    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name\nJOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu\n    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name\nWHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';\n```\n\n### 4. Traffic Analysis\n\n```bash\n# Analyze access logs for endpoint usage\ncat access.log | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20\n\n# Find service-to-service calls from logs\ngrep \"calling service\" app.log | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c\n```\n\n## Documenting Current State\n\n### System Context Diagram\n\n```markdown\n## System Context\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                         [SYSTEM NAME]                                   │\n│                                                                         │\n│     ┌──────────┐                              ┌──────────────┐          │\n│     │ Customer │───── Web/Mobile ─────────────│              │          │\n│     │          │                              │              │          │\n│     └──────────┘                              │   [System]   │          │\n│                                               │              │          │\n│     ┌──────────┐                              │              │          │\n│     │  Admin   │───── Internal Tools ─────────│              │          │\n│     │          │                              │              │          │\n│     └──────────┘                              └──────┬───────┘          │\n│                                                      │                  │\n│                    ┌─────────────────────────────────┼──────────────┐   │\n│                    │                                 │              │   │\n│                    ▼                                 ▼              ▼   │\n│             ┌──────────┐                      ┌──────────┐   ┌────────┐ │\n│             │ Payment  │                      │ Email    │   │Analytics│\n│             │ Gateway  │                      │ Service  │   │         │\n│             │[External]│                      │[External]│   │[External│\n│             └──────────┘                      └──────────┘   └────────┘ │\n│                                                                         │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n```\n\n### Component Inventory\n\n```markdown\n## Component Inventory\n\n| Component | Type | Technology | Version | Owner | Status | Notes |\n|-----------|------|------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|\n| api-gateway | Service | Kong | 2.8 | Platform | 🟢 Healthy | Single instance |\n| order-service | Service | Node.js | 18 | Orders Team | 🟡 Degraded | High memory |\n| payment-service | Service | Python | 3.11 | Payments Team | 🟢 Healthy | |\n| orders-db | Database | PostgreSQL | 14 | DBA | 🟢 Healthy | No replica |\n| cache | Cache | Redis | 7 | Platform | 🟢 Healthy | |\n| queue | Queue | SQS | - | Platform | 🟢 Healthy | |\n```\n\n### Data Flow Diagram\n\n```markdown\n## Data Flow: Order Creation\n\n```\n┌────────┐    1.

Flag Response Guide\n\n### Immediate Actions (Critical)\n\n```markdown\n## When You Find a Critical Red Flag\n\n1. **Document it immediately**\n   - What is the issue?\n   - What is the potential impact?\n   - What evidence do you have?\n\n2. **Assess blast radius**\n   - Who/what is affected?\n   - Is it actively being exploited/failing?\n   - What's the worst case?\n\n3. **Escalate appropriately**\n   - Security issues → Security team + leadership\n   - Availability issues → Engineering leadership + on-call\n   - Compliance issues → Legal + compliance team\n\n4. **Propose immediate mitigation**\n   - What can be done RIGHT NOW to reduce risk?\n   - Not the full fix, just stop the bleeding\n\n5. **Track to resolution**\n   - Create high-priority ticket\n   - Assign
