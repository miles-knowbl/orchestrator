[Source]: [Specific data point]\n2. [Source]: [Specific data point]\n3. [Source]: [Specific data point]\n\n**Implications:**\n- [What this pattern suggests for the problem space]\n- [How this affects potential solutions]\n\n**Counter-evidence:**\n- [Any data points that contradict or weaken the pattern]\n```\n\n### Pattern Strength Assessment\n\n| Confidence Level | Criteria |\n|------------------|----------|\n| **High** | 3+ independent sources, no contradicting evidence, consistent across contexts |\n| **Medium** | 2 sources or strong single source, minor caveats |\n| **Low** | Single source, indirect evidence, or significant counter-evidence |\n\n## Step 4: Contradiction Analysis\n\nContradictions are not problems to hide. They are signals of complexity that must be surfaced.\n\n### Identifying Contradictions\n\n| Contradiction Type | Description | Resolution Approach |\n|--------------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| **Factual** | Sources disagree on facts or data | Verify against primary sources |\n| **Interpretive** | Sources agree on facts, disagree on meaning | Present both interpretations |\n| **Temporal** | Information was true at different times | Note timeline, use most recent |\n| **Perspectival** | Different stakeholders see things differently | Capture all perspectives |\n| **Methodological** | Different methods yield different results | Note methodology differences |\n\n### Contradiction Documentation\n\n```markdown\n### Contradiction: [Brief Title]\n\n**Sources in conflict:**\n- [Source A] claims: \"[Statement]\"\n- [Source B] claims: \"[Statement]\"\n\n**Type:** [Factual / Interpretive / Temporal / Perspectival / Methodological]\n**Severity:** [Critical / Significant / Minor]\n\n**Analysis:**\n[Why these sources disagree and what it means]\n\n**Resolution:**\n- [ ] Resolved: [Explanation]\n- [ ] Unresolved: Flagged for further investigation\n- [ ] Irrelevant: Does not affect downstream work\n\n**Impact on Insights:**\n[How this contradiction affects the reliability of related themes or patterns]\n```\n\n### Contradiction Severity Guide\n\n| Severity | Definition | Action Required |\n|----------|------------|-----------------|\n| **Critical** | Affects core assumptions or key decisions | Must resolve before proceeding |\n| **Significant** | Affects secondary themes or supporting evidence | Flag clearly, attempt resolution |\n| **Minor** | Peripheral disagreement, does not affect main findings | Document and move on |\n\n## Step 5: Gap Analysis\n\nGaps are what you do not know but need to know. Identifying them is as valuable as identifying themes.\n\n### Gap Discovery Questions\n\n| Domain | Questions to Ask |\n|--------|------------------|\n| **Stakeholder** | Whose perspective is missing? Who was not consulted? |\n| **Temporal** | What time periods are not covered? Is context current? |\n| **Technical** | What technical details are assumed but unverified? |\n| **Quantitative** | Where are opinions stated without supporting numbers? |\n| **Competitive** | What do we not know about alternatives or competitors? |\n| **Risk** | What risks have not been assessed? |\n| **User** | What user needs are assumed but not validated? |\n\n### Gap Classification\n\n```markdown\n### Gap: [Brief Title]\n\n**Domain:** [Stakeholder / Temporal / Technical / Quantitative / Competitive / Risk / User]\n**Severity:** [Blocking / Important / Nice-to-have]\n\n**What is missing:**\n[Clear description of the missing information]\n\n**Why it matters:**\n[Impact on analysis quality and downstream decisions]\n\n**How to fill:**\n- [ ] [Specific action to obtain the missing information]\n- [ ] [Alternative source if primary is unavailable]\n\n**Workaround if unfillable:**\n[How to proceed if the gap cannot be filled]\n```\n\n### Gap Severity Definitions\n\n| Severity | Definition | Implication |\n|----------|------------|-------------|\n| **Blocking** | Cannot produce reliable insights without this | Pause cultivation, return to ingestion |\n| **Important** | Insights are less reliable without this | Proceed with caveats, flag in output |\n| **Nice-to-have** | Would strengthen analysis but not essential | Note for future investigation |\n\n## Step 6: Opportunity Mapping\n\nOpportunities emerge at the intersection of themes, patterns, and gaps. This step transforms analytical findings into forward-looking possibilities.\n\n### Opportunity Sources\n\n| Source | How Opportunities Emerge |\n|--------|--------------------------|\n| **Strong themes** | Validated needs or interests become addressable areas |\n| **Recurring patterns** | Systematic behaviors suggest leverage points |\n| **Gaps in the market** | Missing capabilities or unmet needs |\n| **Contradictions** | Unresolved tensions that a solution could bridge |\n| **Convergence** | Multiple themes pointing toward the same space |\n| **Absence patterns** | What nobody is doing that should be done |\n\n### Opportunity Documentation\n\n```markdown\n### Opportunity: [Descriptive Title]\n\n**Source:** [Which themes/patterns/gaps suggest this]\n**Confidence:** High / Medium / Low\n**Novelty:** Novel / Incremental / Established\n\n**Description:**\n[What the opportunity is and why it exists]\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Theme: [Related theme and connection]\n- Pattern: [Related pattern and connection]\n- Gap: [Related gap this could fill]\n\n**Potential Impact:** [High / Medium / Low]\n**Feasibility Notes:** [Any initial assessment of viability]\n```\n\n## Step 7: Insight Synthesis\n\nSynthesis is where all prior steps converge into a coherent narrative. An insight is not a fact restated --- it is a new understanding derived from combining multiple data points.\n\n### Insight Qualities\n\n| Quality | Test |\n|---------|------|\n| **Novel** | Does it say something the sources do not say individually? |\n| **Evidenced** | Can you trace it back to specific data points? |\n| **Actionable** | Does it suggest what to do, not just what is? |\n| **Specific** | Is it concrete enough to inform a decision? |\n| **Honest** | Does it acknowledge its own limitations? |\n\n### Synthesis Techniques\n\n| Technique | Method | Best For |\n|-----------|--------|----------|\n| **Triangulation** | Combine 3+ sources on same topic for robust finding | Validating key claims |\n| **Abstraction** | Move from specific observations to general principles | Finding transferable insights |\n| **Narrative threading** | Connect insights into a coherent story | Communicating to stakeholders |\n| **Inversion** | Ask \"what would be true if the opposite held?\" | Stress-testing assumptions |\n| **Implication chains** | Follow \"if this is true, then...\" to second-order effects | Uncovering hidden consequences |\n\n### Insight Template\n\n```markdown\n### Insight: [Title]\n\n**Confidence:** High / Medium / Low\n**Synthesis Method:** [Triangulation / Abstraction / Narrative / Inversion / Implication Chain]\n\n**Statement:**\n[One clear sentence stating the insight]\n\n**Derivation:**\n[How this insight emerges from the underlying evidence]\n- Theme: [Related theme]\n- Pattern: [Related pattern]\n- Additional evidence: [Any supporting data]\n\n**Implications:**\n- [What this means for the problem space]\n- [What this means for potential solutions]\n\n**Caveats:**\n- [What could make this insight wrong]\n- [Confidence-reducing factors]\n```\n\n## Step 8: Confidence Assessment\n\nEvery cultivated output must carry a confidence rating. Intellectual honesty about uncertainty is a feature, not a weakness.\n\n### Confidence Framework\n\n| Level | Definition | Evidence Threshold |\n|-------|------------|--------------------|\n| **Established** | Multiple strong sources agree, no counter-evidence | 4+ independent confirmations |\n| **Strong** | Clear evidence from reliable sources | 2-3 reliable sources |\n| **Moderate** | Supported but with caveats or limited sources | 1-2 sources with partial corroboration |\n| **Emerging** | Suggestive but not conclusive | Pattern visible but not fully confirmed |\n| **Speculative** | Logical inference without direct evidence | Derived from implication chains only |\n\n### Assumption Register\n\nDocument assumptions that underpin insights:\n\n```markdown\n| ID | Assumption | Affects | Evidence | Risk if Wrong |\n|----|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|\n| A1 | Market size is growing | Opportunity 1 | Industry report (2024) | Solution targets shrinking market |\n| A2 | Users prefer self-service | Theme 3 | 2 interviews | Need different engagement model |\n| A3 | Budget is available | Feasibility | Client conversation | Scope reduction needed |\n```\n\n## Output Formats\n\n### Quick Cultivation (3-5 Sources, Focused Scope)\n\n```markdown\n# Cultivated Context: [Topic]\n\n## Key Themes\n1. **[Theme 1]** (Strong) --- [One-line summary with source count]\n2. **[Theme 2]** (Moderate) --- [One-line summary with source count]\n3. **[Theme 3]** (Emerging) --- [One-line summary with source count]\n\n## Critical Patterns\n- **[Pattern]:** [Description] (Confidence: [Level])\n\n## Gaps\n- **[Gap 1]** ([Severity]): [What is missing]\n- **[Gap 2]** ([Severity]): [What is missing]\n\n## Top Insights\n1.

This is the strongest form of evidence in qualitative analysis. When three or more unrelated sources independently surface the same theme, confidence is high regardless of individual source reliability.\n\n**Use when:** Several sources from different perspectives reach similar conclusions independently.\n\n### The Iceberg Pattern\n\nSurface-level themes mask deeper structural issues. Initial coding reveals obvious topics, but second-pass analysis reveals the underlying dynamics driving those surface symptoms. The visible themes are symptoms; the real insight is the root cause beneath.\n\n**Use when:** Themes feel symptomatic rather than causal, and you suspect deeper structural factors.\n\n### The Silence Pattern\n\nWhat sources do not mention is as informative as what they do. When a topic you would expect to appear is consistently absent, this absence is itself a pattern. It may indicate an unrecognized risk, a blind spot in the domain, or an assumption so deeply held that nobody questions it.\n\n**Use when:** Expected topics are missing from all sources, or a critical perspective is unrepresented.\n\n### The Tension Pattern\n\nTwo legitimate but opposing forces create a productive tension. Rather than resolving the contradiction, the insight is that the tension itself defines the problem space. Solutions must navigate between the poles, not eliminate one side.\n\n**Use when:** Contradictions cannot be resolved because both sides have valid evidence, suggesting a both/and rather than either/or situation.\n\n## Relationship to Other Skills\n\n| Skill | Relationship |\n|-------|--------------|\n| `context-ingestion` | Ingestion provides RAW-CONTEXT.md and CONTEXT-SOURCES.md as inputs |\n| `priority-matrix` | Cultivated themes and opportunities feed into prioritization dimensions |\n| `proposal-builder` | Insights, patterns, and evidence feed directly into proposal narrative |\n| `architect` | Technical patterns and gaps inform architectural decisions |\n| `spec` | Cultivated requirements and constraints feed into specifications |\n| `content-analysis` | May provide additional analytical depth on specific content types |\n\n## Key Principles\n\n**Evidence over intuition.** Every theme, pattern, and insight must trace back to specific source material. If you cannot point to the evidence, it is an assumption, not a finding.\n\n**Gaps are findings.** Identifying what is missing is as valuable as identifying what is present. A well-documented gap prevents downstream teams from building on incomplete information.\n\n**Confidence is a spectrum.** Not all insights are created equal. Rating confidence honestly allows downstream consumers to make informed decisions about how much weight to give each finding.\n\n**Synthesis is not summarization.** Summaries compress information. Synthesis creates new understanding by combining information in ways that reveal what no single source could show alone.\n\n**Contradictions are signals.** When sources disagree, the instinct is to pick a side. Instead, treat contradictions as data points that reveal complexity in the problem space.\n\n**Cultivate, do not fabricate.** Insights must grow from the data. Resist the temptation to impose a narrative that the evidence does not support, no matter how elegant it would be.\n\n## References\n\n- `references/qualitative-analysis.md`: Methods for coding, categorizing, and analyzing qualitative data\n- `references/synthesis-framework.md`: Framework for combining insights across heterogeneous sources\n- `references/gap-analysis-techniques.md`: Systematic approaches to identifying missing information\n- `references/contradiction-resolution.md`: Strategies for handling conflicting source material\n- `references/opportunity-mapping.md`: Techniques for identifying latent possibilities in analyzed context",

      "content": "# Qualitative Analysis Methods\n\nSystematic approaches for coding and categorizing qualitative data during context cultivation.\n\n## The Three-Stage Coding Process\n\nQualitative coding progresses through three stages. Each stage operates at a higher level of abstraction.\n\n### Stage 1: Open Coding\n\nRead each source without preconceptions. Label every meaningful segment with a descriptive code.\n\n| Principle | Guidance |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Granularity** | One code per distinct idea; do not bundle multiple concepts |\n| **Language** | Use in-vivo codes (source's own words) when possible |\n| **Exhaustiveness** | Code every relevant segment; do not skip based on perceived importance |\n| **Neutrality** | Describe what is said, not what you think it means |\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read the full source once without marking anything\n2. Re-read and assign a short descriptive label to each meaningful segment\n3. Record the exact segment text alongside the code for traceability\n4. Use consistent naming: lowercase, hyphenated (e.g., `user-abandons-checkout`)\n\n**Example open codes from a product feedback source:**\n```\nSegment: \"I tried three times but the upload kept failing\"\nCode: upload-failure-repeated\n\nSegment: \"The dashboard loads fast but I can never find what I need\"\nCode: dashboard-findability-poor\n\nSegment: \"We switched from Competitor X because of pricing\"\nCode: competitor-pricing-driver\n```\n\n### Stage 2: Axial Coding\n\nGroup related open codes into categories. Look for relationships between codes.\n\n| Relationship Type | Question | Example |\n|-------------------|----------|---------|\n| **Causal** | Does one code cause another? | `slow-response` causes `user-frustration` |\n| **Contextual** | When or where does this code appear? | `error-spike` appears during `peak-hours` |\n| **Consequential** | What results from this code? | `poor-onboarding` leads to `early-churn` |\n| **Associative** | Do these codes co-occur? | `mobile-user` associates with `simplified-workflow` |\n\n**Process:**\n1. Lay out all open codes (physically or in a list)\n2. Sort codes that share a relationship into groups\n3. Name each group with a category label\n4. Document why codes belong together\n5. Note codes that fit multiple categories (these often signal important connections)\n\n### Stage 3: Selective Coding\n\nIdentify 3-7 core themes that connect your categories into a coherent narrative.\n\n**Theme formation criteria:**\n- Spans at least 2 categories\n- Supported by evidence from 2+ independent sources\n- Reveals something not obvious from any single code\n- Can be stated as a declarative sentence\n\n**Process:**\n1. Review all categories and ask: \"What story do these tell together?\"\n2. Draft candidate theme statements\n3. Test each theme against the evidence (can you trace it back to specific codes?)\n4. Discard themes that lack sufficient grounding\n5. Rank themes by strength (source count, evidence quality, consistency)\n\n## Thematic Coding Quick Reference\n\n| Step | Input | Output | Duration Guide |\n|------|-------|--------|----------------|\n| Open coding | Raw source text | 20-50 individual codes per source | 60% of coding time |\n| Axial coding | All open codes | 5-15 categories | 25% of coding time |\n| Selective coding | All categories | 3-7 themes | 15% of coding time |\n\n## Grounded Theory Principles for Context Cultivation\n\nGrounded theory insists that findings emerge from data rather than being imposed on it.\n\n| Principle | Application |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Theoretical sensitivity** | Stay alert to what the data is saying, not what you expect it to say |\n| **Constant comparison** | Continuously compare new codes against existing ones for consistency |\n| **Theoretical saturation** | Stop coding when new sources stop producing new codes |\n| **Memo writing** | Record analytical thoughts as they occur; these become insight seeds |\n| **Negative case analysis** | Actively seek evidence that contradicts emerging themes |\n\n## Code-to-Theme Progression Example\n\n**Domain:** Enterprise software adoption barriers\n\n```\nOPEN CODES (15 selected from 40+):\n  training-insufficient, documentation-outdated, admin-overwhelmed,\n  integration-complex, migration-risky, data-loss-fear,\n  champion-departed, executive-skeptical, budget-frozen,\n  vendor-unresponsive, support-slow, contract-unclear,\n  workflow-disruption, parallel-systems, productivity-dip\n\nCATEGORIES (5):\n  Knowledge Gap:     training-insufficient, documentation-outdated\n  Technical Risk:    integration-complex, migration-risky, data-loss-fear\n  Organizational:    champion-departed, executive-skeptical, budget-frozen\n  Vendor Trust:      vendor-unresponsive, support-slow, contract-unclear\n  Transition Cost:   workflow-disruption, parallel-systems, productivity-dip\n\nTHEMES (3):\n  1. \"Adoption fails at the organizational layer, not the technical layer\"\n     - Organizational + Vendor Trust categories dominate\n     - Technical Risk is real but secondary\n  2. \"Knowledge transfer is the hidden bottleneck\"\n     - Knowledge Gap + Transition Cost interlock\n     - Training investment predicts adoption success\n  3. \"Trust must be earned before and during adoption, not after\"\n     - Vendor Trust + Organizational categories intertwine\n     - Champion departure collapses trust structures\n```\n\n## Coding Hygiene Checklist\n\nBefore completing thematic coding, verify:\n\n```\n- [ ] Code names are consistent across all sources (no synonymous duplicates)\n- [ ] Every code maps to at least one category\n- [ ] No category contains fewer than 2 codes (merge or reclassify singletons)\n- [ ] Every theme traces back to specific codes and segments\n- [ ] At least one theme is supported by 3+ independent sources\n- [ ] Memos document the reasoning behind non-obvious groupings\n- [ ] Counter-evidence has been sought for each theme\n- [ ] Source attribution is preserved at every level (code, category, theme)\n```\n"

      "content": "# Synthesis Framework\n\nTechniques for combining analytical findings into coherent, actionable insights during context cultivation.\n\n## Triangulation Techniques\n\nTriangulation validates findings by confirming them through multiple independent lines of evidence.\n\n### Types of Triangulation\n\n| Type | Method | Strength |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| **Source triangulation** | Same finding confirmed by 3+ different sources | Strongest; independent corroboration eliminates source bias |\n| **Method triangulation** | Same finding confirmed by different analytical approaches | Strong; reduces methodological blind spots |\n| **Perspective triangulation** | Same finding confirmed from different stakeholder viewpoints | Moderate-strong; demonstrates broad relevance |\n| **Temporal triangulation** | Same finding confirmed across different time periods | Moderate; demonstrates persistence and durability |\n\n### Applying Triangulation\n\n**Step 1:** Select a candidate finding (theme, pattern, or preliminary insight).\n**Step 2:** Identify all evidence supporting it and tag each evidence item by source, method, perspective, and time.\n**Step 3:** Assess triangulation strength:\n\n| Triangulation Level | Criteria | Confidence Boost |\n|---------------------|----------|------------------|\n| **Full** | 3+ sources, 2+ perspectives, consistent over time | High confidence finding |\n| **Partial** | 2 sources or 2 perspectives, no contradictions | Moderate confidence finding |\n| **Single-point** | One source, one perspective, one time point | Low confidence; flag for validation |\n| **Contradicted** | Evidence exists both for and against | Do not synthesize; route to contradiction resolution |\n\n**Step 4:** Only promote fully or partially triangulated findings to insight synthesis. Single-point findings remain as emerging observations.\n\n### Triangulation Documentation\n\nRecord each evidence item with its source, type (primary/secondary), perspective, and time period. State the triangulation level achieved (Full/Partial/Single-point/Contradicted).\n\n## Abstraction Laddering\n\nAbstraction laddering moves between concrete observations and abstract principles to find the level where insights are most actionable.\n\n### The Three Levels\n\n- **Abstract** (\"Why does this matter?\") --- Principles, strategic implications, transferable truths\n- **Middle** (\"What does this mean?\") --- Patterns, interpretations, contextual understanding\n- **Concrete** (\"What did we observe?\") --- Specific data points, quotes, measurements\n\n### Laddering Process\n\n**Step 1: Anchor in concrete.** Start with specific observations from your coded data.\n**Step 2: Climb to meaning.** Ask \"Why?\" and \"So what?\" to move up the ladder.\n**Step 3: Test at abstract.** Formulate a general principle or strategic implication.\n**Step 4: Descend to action.** Ask \"What would we do differently?\" to make the abstract actionable.\n\n### Example\n\n```\nCONCRETE:  \"3 of 5 sources mention users creating spreadsheet workarounds\n            for the reporting feature.\"\n\nCLIMB:     Why? --> The reporting feature does not meet actual user needs.\n           So what? --> Users will invest effort to get what they need\n           regardless of what the product provides.\n\nABSTRACT:  \"User workarounds are the strongest signal of unmet product needs.\n            The effort users invest in workarounds quantifies the value of\n            the missing capability.\"\n\nDESCEND:   Action: Map all documented workarounds as a proxy for feature\n           prioritization. The most elaborate workarounds indicate the\n           highest-value gaps.\n```\n\n### Laddering Pitfalls\n\n| Pitfall | Description | Fix |\n|---------|-------------|-----|\n| **Staying too concrete** | Restating observations without interpreting them | Force yourself to ask \"So what?\" at least twice |\n| **Flying too abstract** | Producing platitudes disconnected from evidence | Every abstract statement must trace to specific data |\n| **Skipping levels** | Jumping from data to grand theory | Walk the ladder step by step; document each rung |\n| **One-way travel** | Abstracting without returning to action | Always complete the round trip: concrete to abstract to actionable |\n\n## Narrative Threading\n\nNarrative threading connects disparate insights into a coherent story that stakeholders can follow and act on.\n\n### Thread Construction Process\n\n1. **Identify the spine.** Select the single most important insight as the narrative backbone.\n2. **Attach supporting threads.** Connect secondary insights that reinforce, qualify, or extend the spine.\n3. **Weave in contradictions.** Show where the story is complicated; this builds credibility.\n4. **Surface the gaps.** Acknowledge what the narrative cannot yet explain.\n5. **End with implications.** State what the story means for decisions.\n\n### Thread Types\n\n| Thread Type | Role in Narrative | Connector Language |\n|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **Reinforcing** | Strengthens the main insight | \"Furthermore...\", \"This is consistent with...\" |\n| **Qualifying** | Adds nuance or conditions | \"However, this applies primarily when...\", \"With the caveat that...\" |\n| **Extending** | Explores implications | \"This suggests that...\", \"If this holds, then...\" |\n| **Contrasting** | Presents counter-evidence | \"On the other hand...\", \"This is complicated by...\" |\n| **Bridging** | Connects otherwise unrelated findings | \"Unexpectedly, this connects to...\", \"The link between X and Y...\" |\n\n### Example Narrative Structure\n\n```markdown\n**Spine:** Onboarding is the primary conversion barrier.\n**Reinforcing:** Support tickets confirm onboarding generates 60% of first-week contacts.\n**Qualifying:** Applies to self-service users; enterprise clients with dedicated onboarding see 2x activation.\n**Extending:** Feature investment without onboarding improvement will not move conversion metrics.\n**Contrasting:** One source suggests pricing drives churn, but their data covers post-onboarding users only.\n**Bridging:** Workaround patterns in feature analysis also appear in onboarding --- same \"unmet guidance need.\"\n**Implication:** Prioritize onboarding experience over new features for the next quarter.\n```\n\n## Insight Quality Tests\n\nEvery synthesized insight must pass five quality tests before inclusion in the cultivation output.\n\n| Test | Question | Pass Criteria | Fail Indicator |\n|------|----------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Specific** | Is it concrete enough to act on? | Someone could design a response to this insight | Vague or could apply to any situation |\n| **Evidenced** | Can you trace it to source data? | At least 2 coded data points support it | \"I think...\" or \"It seems...\" without citations |\n| **Actionable** | Does it suggest what to do? | Implies a decision or direction | Purely descriptive with no forward motion |\n| **Novel** | Does it say something the sources do not say individually? | Combines findings into new understanding | Restates a single source's conclusion |\n| **Relevant** | Does it matter for the problem at hand? | Connects to the analysis objectives | Interesting but tangential finding |\n\n### Applying the SEANR Test\n\nScore each insight. All five must pass before inclusion:\n\n```\nInsight: \"[Statement]\"\n  [x] Specific   [x] Evidenced   [ ] Actionable   [x] Novel   [x] Relevant\n  Result: 4/5 -- Revise for actionability before including\n```\n\n**Revision for failing tests:** Not specific --- add who, what, when, how much. Not evidenced --- find data or downgrade. Not actionable --- append \"This means we should...\" Not novel --- discard or combine with other findings. Not relevant --- connect to objectives or move to appendix.\n\n## Synthesis Checklist\n\n```\n- [ ] All strong themes triangulated\n- [ ] Key findings abstraction-laddered (concrete to abstract to actionable)\n- [ ] Narrative thread connects the top 3-5 insights\n- [ ] Every insight passes SEANR (5/5)\n- [ ] Contradictions woven into narrative, not hidden\n- [ ] Gaps acknowledged with confidence impact\n- [ ] The synthesis says something new beyond any single source\n```\n"
