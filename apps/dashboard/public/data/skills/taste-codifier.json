  "content": "# Taste Codifier\n\nExtracts voice patterns from source material to produce a comprehensive, format-agnostic taste schema.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- User provides source material and wants their \"voice\" or \"style\" codified\n- User wants a schema that can later drive consistent content generation\n- User says \"codify my taste\", \"capture my voice\", \"create a style profile\"\n\n## Core Concept\n\nA **taste schema** captures the full \"universe\" of a voice—every dimension that makes content recognizable as coming from that creator. It is:\n- **Format-agnostic**: Pure essence, not tied to any output type\n- **MECE**: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive across dimensions\n- **Maximalist**: Every field populated, even with low-confidence extrapolations\n- **Derivable**: Downstream skills use this schema to produce specific outputs (image schemas, text schemas, video schemas)\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Source Inventory\n\nCatalog all provided sources:\n```\nText: docs, transcripts, posts, articles, emails\nImage: graphics, photos, slides, brand materials  \nVideo: presentations, interviews, social content\n```\n\nCount sources per category—this determines confidence levels.\n\n### Step 2: Read Analysis Guide\n\nRead `references/analysis-guide.md` for detailed extraction techniques. Key phases:\n1. Textual pattern extraction (7 dimensions)\n2. Visual pattern extraction (5 dimensions)\n3. Anti-pattern identification\n4. Confidence calibration\n\n### Step 3: Extract Patterns\n\nWork through each dimension systematically. For each:\n- Find multiple examples in source material\n- Identify the underlying pattern (not just instances)\n- Note frequency and consistency\n- Collect signature examples\n\n**Textual Dimensions:**\n1. Narrative mechanics (arc types, specificity anchors, story patterns)\n2. Rhetorical signature (analogies, humor, contrarian inversions)\n3. Emotional architecture (vulnerability, triumph, gratitude layers)\n4. Identity threads (core claims, belonging dynamics)\n5. Teaching moves (frameworks, advice inversions)\n6. Audience relationship (hooks, intimacy, permissions)\n7. Narrative metadata (audience adaptations, story clusters, phrases)\n\n**Visual Dimensions:**\n1. Color system (palette, relationships, emotional associations)\n2. Typography system (heading/body/accent styles, hierarchy)\n3. Composition system (layout, whitespace, flow)\n4. Imagery system (illustration, icons, motifs, metaphors)\n5. Mood/atmosphere (energy, texture, lighting, emotion)\n\n### Step 4: Identify Anti-Patterns\n\nDocument what is conspicuously absent:\n- Textual patterns never used\n- Visual approaches avoided\n- Topics off-limits\n- Tones that don't appear\n\n### Step 5: Populate Schema\n\nUse `references/schema-structure.json` as the template. Fill every field:\n- High-confidence fields: Direct evidence from sources\n- Low-confidence fields: Reasonable extrapolations, marked as such\n\n### Step 6: Calibrate Confidence\n\nSet confidence levels based on:\n- **High**: 20+ text sources, 10+ images, patterns at 70%+ consistency\n- **Medium**: 5-20 text, 3-10 images, 40-70% consistency\n- **Low**: <5 text, <3 images, <40% consistency\n\nLow confidence still requires all fields populated—just note uncertainty.\n\n### Step 7: Validate\n\nBefore delivering:\n1. Read key sections aloud—does it sound like the voice?\n2. Could someone unfamiliar recreate the voice from this schema?\n3. Check for contradictions between dimensions\n4. Ensure anti-patterns are documented\n\n## Output Format\n\nDeliver as a single JSON file named `{voice-name}-taste-schema.json`.\n\nThe schema should be immediately usable by downstream derivative skills to produce:\n- Image schemas (infographics, graphics, charts)\n- Text schemas (articles, posts, threads)\n- Video schemas (storyboards with timing)\n\n## Key Principles\n\n**Fill every field.** The taste schema is maximalist. Even sparse source material should yield a complete schema—mark low-confidence extrapolations but don't leave gaps.\n\n**Pattern over instance.** Don't just list examples—identify the underlying pattern. \"Self-deprecating humor placed before credentials to disarm\" not \"Makes jokes.\"\n\n**Anti-patterns are patterns.** What's absent defines the voice as much as what's present.\n\n**Essence first.** If time-constrained, prioritize: core DNA → emotional architecture → narrative mechanics → rhetorical signature → audience relationship → visual dimensions.\n\n## Example Essence Block\n\nFrom the Cliff Weitzman voice analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"essence\": {\n    \"core_dna\": \"Transform shame into superpowers through specific numbers, earned vulnerability, and contrarian reframes.\",\n    \"values\": [\"persistence\", \"vulnerability as strength\", \"brute force\", \"gratitude\", \"helping others like past self\"],\n    \"worldview\": \"Weakness contains hidden strength; rejection is data, not verdict; the universe has a plan.\",\n    \"emotional_signature\": \"Vulnerable optimism backed by quantified improbability\",\n    \"transformation_promise\": \"Permission to be slower, different, or rejected—and still succeed\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n\n- `references/schema-structure.json`: Full JSON schema template with field descriptions\n- `references/analysis-guide.md`: Detailed extraction techniques for each dimension\n- `references/dimension-definitions.md`: Quick reference for understanding each dimension",

      "content": "# Taste Analysis Guide\n\nHow to extract voice patterns from diverse source material to populate a taste schema.\n\n## Analysis Workflow\n\n### Phase 1: Source Inventory\n\nBefore analysis, catalog all sources:\n\n```\nText Sources:\n- Documents (docx, pdf, md, txt)\n- Transcripts (video/podcast/interview)\n- Social media posts\n- Emails/newsletters\n- Published articles\n\nImage Sources:\n- Graphics/infographics\n- Photography\n- Slide decks\n- Social media images\n- Brand materials\n\nVideo Sources:\n- Presentations\n- Interviews\n- Social content\n- Tutorials\n```\n\nCount and categorize. This informs confidence levels.\n\n### Phase 2: Textual Pattern Extraction\n\n#### 2.1 Narrative Mechanics\n\n**Arc Detection:**\nRead through content looking for story patterns. For each story:\n1. Identify the starting state (shame, weakness, rejection, fear, problem)\n2. Identify the ending state (liberation, strength, fit, mastery, creation)\n3. Note the transformation mechanism\n4. Record frequency of each arc type\n\n**Specificity Mining:**\n- Extract all numbers (exact counts, times, percentages)\n- Note number style (precise: \"27 hours\" vs rounded: \"about 30\")\n- Collect sensory details (physical sensations, environment descriptions)\n- List all proper nouns (people, places, institutions, pop culture references)\n\n#### 2.2 Rhetorical Signature\n\n**Analogy Mapping:**\nFor each explanation of an abstract concept:\n1. What source domain is used? (sports, cooking, gaming, etc.)\n2. What's the structural mapping?\n3. How is it introduced? (\"It's like...\", \"Think of it as...\", \"Imagine...\")\n\n**Humor Analysis:**\nFor each humorous moment:\n1. Classify mode (self-deprecating, absurdist, observational, wordplay)\n2. Identify function (disarms before credentials, softens after vulnerability, creates memory)\n3. Note placement patterns\n\n**Inversion Detection:**\nLook for contrarian positions:\n1. What conventional wisdom is stated?\n2. What opposite position is taken?\n3. What proof is offered?\n\n#### 2.3 Emotional Architecture\n\n**Vulnerability Inventory:**\n- Shame admissions: What does the voice admit was embarrassing/shameful?\n- Fear admissions: What fears are acknowledged?\n- Failure admissions: What failures are owned?\n- Check: Are vulnerabilities specific + past + overcome?\n\n**Triumph Pairing:**\nFor each success mentioned:\n1. What struggle preceded it?\n2. How is improbability framed?\n3. What present-day proof validates it?\n\n**Gratitude Mapping:**\n- Who is thanked?\n- For what specific action?\n- With what specific impact noted?\n\n#### 2.4 Identity Threads\n\n**Claim Extraction:**\n- \"I am...\" statements (identity labels)\n- \"I do...\" statements (action-based identity—stronger)\n- \"I believe...\" statements (worldview)\n\n**Belonging Analysis:**\n- What made them an outsider?\n- What moment marked belonging?\n- How do they bridge both worlds now?\n\n#### 2.5 Teaching Moves\n\n**Framework Inventory:**\n- Named frameworks (look for numbers, alliteration, metaphors in titles)\n- Component structure\n- When each framework is deployed\n\n**Advice Pattern:**\n- Common advice being challenged\n- Their alternative position\n- Lived proof backing it\n\n#### 2.6 Audience Relationship\n\n**Hook Identification:**\n- What feelings create instant recognition? (imposter syndrome, being behind, hiding struggles)\n- How are hooks phrased? (first person internal monologue preferred)\n- Where do hooks appear?\n\n**Intimacy Moments:**\n- Private rituals shared\n- Family moments revealed\n- Spiritual/personal practices disclosed\n\n**Permission Extraction:**\nWhat is the audience implicitly/explicitly allowed to feel/do/be?\n\n#### 2.7 Signature Phrases\n\nCollect recurring language:\n- Opening patterns\n- Transition phrases\n- Closing moves\n\n### Phase 3: Visual Pattern Extraction\n\n#### 3.1 Color Analysis\n\nFrom images/graphics/presentations:\n- Dominant colors (what appears most)\n- Supporting colors\n- Accent colors for emphasis\n- Color temperature (warm/cool)\n- Saturation levels (muted/vibrant)\n- Contrast approach (high/low)\n\n#### 3.2 Typography Analysis\n\n- Heading characteristics (weight, style, personality)\n- Body text approach (readability, density)\n- Accent typography (quotes, callouts)\n- Hierarchy patterns\n\n#### 3.3 Composition Analysis\n\n- Layout patterns (grid, asymmetric, centered)\n- Whitespace approach (dense/airy)\n- Visual flow direction\n- Element grouping patterns\n\n#### 3.4 Imagery Analysis\n\n- Illustration style (if present)\n- Icon style (line weight, fill, complexity)\n- Recurring visual motifs\n- Photography style (if present)\n- Visual metaphor patterns\n\n#### 3.5 Mood Analysis\n\n- Overall energy level\n- Texture presence\n- Lighting tendencies (in photos/illustrations)\n- Emotional register\n\n### Phase 4: Anti-Pattern Identification\n\nReview for what's conspicuously absent:\n- What content patterns are never used?\n- What visual approaches are avoided?\n- What topics are off-limits?\n- What tones don't appear?\n\nThe absence of patterns is as informative as their presence.\n\n### Phase 5: Confidence Calibration\n\nRate confidence based on:\n\n**High Confidence (abundant evidence):**\n- 20+ text sources across multiple formats\n- 10+ image sources\n- Consistent patterns appearing 70%+ of the time\n- Multiple contexts represented\n\n**Medium Confidence (moderate evidence):**\n- 5-20 text sources\n- 3-10 image sources\n- Patterns appearing 40-70% of the time\n- Some variety in contexts\n\n**Low Confidence (limited evidence):**\n- Fewer than 5 text sources\n- Fewer than 3 image sources\n- Patterns appearing less than 40%\n- Limited context variety\n\nFor low-confidence dimensions, still fill all fields but mark extrapolations clearly in the schema.\n\n### Phase 6: Cross-Validation\n\nBefore finalizing:\n1. Read schema aloud—does it sound like the voice?\n2. Could someone unfamiliar recreate the voice from this schema?\n3. Are there contradictions between dimensions?\n4. Is anything critical missing?\n\n## Analysis Shortcuts\n\n**For time-constrained analysis:**\n\nIf you have limited sources, prioritize extraction in this order:\n1. Essence (core DNA, values, emotional signature)\n2. Narrative mechanics (arc types, specificity)\n3. Emotional architecture (vulnerability formula, triumph pairing)\n4. Rhetorical signature (analogies, inversions)\n5. Audience relationship (hooks, permissions)\n6. Visual dimensions (if any visual sources exist)\n7. Everything else\n\nThis order captures the most voice-defining elements first.\n\n## Common Extraction Mistakes\n\n- **Over-generalizing**: \"Uses humor\" vs \"Self-deprecating humor placed before credentials to disarm\"\n- **Missing anti-patterns**: Not documenting what's absent\n- **Confusing topic with voice**: Recording WHAT they talk about, not HOW they talk\n- **Insufficient examples**: Listing patterns without signature examples\n- **Visual-textual mismatch**: Visual style that doesn't match textual emotional register\n"
