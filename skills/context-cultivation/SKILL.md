# Context Cultivation

Transform raw context into actionable insights.

## When to Use

- After context ingestion is complete
- When you have raw information needing analysis
- To identify patterns across multiple sources
- When you say: "analyze this context", "find patterns", "what are the themes"

## Required Deliverables

| Deliverable | Location | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| CULTIVATED-CONTEXT.md | Root | Processed and synthesized insights |
| PATTERNS.md | Root | Identified patterns and themes |
| GAPS.md | Root | Missing information and open questions |

## Analysis Dimensions

| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| Themes | What topics appear repeatedly? |
| Patterns | What behaviors or structures recur? |
| Gaps | What information is missing? |
| Contradictions | Where do sources disagree? |
| Opportunities | What possibilities emerge? |

## Success Criteria

- All major themes identified
- Patterns documented with evidence
- Gaps explicitly listed
- Insights are actionable
