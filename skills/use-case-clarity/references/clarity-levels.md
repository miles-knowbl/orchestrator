# Use Case Clarity Levels Reference

Framework for assessing use case maturity.

## Level 1: Vague (0-34)

**Definition:** They know they want "AI" but don't know what for.

### Signals

- "We need to do something with AI"
- "Everyone's talking about AI"
- "Our competitors are using AI"
- "The board wants an AI strategy"
- Can't articulate specific problem to solve
- No specific automation target
- Changes topic when asked for details

### Implications

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Sales cycle | Very long — need to educate |
| Deal risk | High — may not close |
| Next step | Discovery/workshop needed |
| Proposal | Not ready |
| Pricing | Cannot scope accurately |

### Actions Needed

1. Extensive discovery
2. Help them identify specific pain
3. Present use case options
4. May need to walk away if no clarity emerges

---

## Level 2: Exploring (35-59)

**Definition:** They have a general area in mind but haven't defined specifics.

### Signals

- "We want to automate customer support"
- "Looking to reduce manual work"
- "Want to improve response times"
- General problem area identified
- No specific interactions or flows
- "Something like what [company] did"
- Asks "what can AI do?"

### Implications

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Sales cycle | Medium — need to shape |
| Deal risk | Moderate — depends on shaping |
| Next step | Scoping sessions |
| Proposal | Not yet ready |
| Pricing | Range only |

### Actions Needed

1. Discovery to narrow scope
2. Present specific use case options
3. Help prioritize
4. Define phase 1 scope

---

## Level 3: Defined (60-84)

**Definition:** Clear automation target with most parameters known.

### Signals

- "We want to automate Tier 1 support inquiries"
- "Specifically: returns, exchanges, order status"
- "For our web chat channel"
- "Target: reduce tickets by 30%"
- Can explain user journey
- Has thought about edge cases
- Knows who owns this

### Implications

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Sales cycle | Standard |
| Deal risk | Lower |
| Next step | Proposal ready |
| Proposal | Can scope accurately |
| Pricing | Can provide accurate quote |

### Actions Needed

1. Fill in remaining gaps
2. Confirm scope boundaries
3. Establish baseline metrics
4. Move to proposal

---

## Level 4: Scoped (85-100)

**Definition:** Ready for implementation. All parameters defined.

### Signals

- Detailed requirements document
- Specific interactions enumerated
- In/out of scope clear
- Success metrics with baselines
- User flows documented
- Edge cases identified
- Escalation path defined
- Timeline and phasing clear

### Implications

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Sales cycle | Fast |
| Deal risk | Low |
| Next step | Contract/pilot |
| Proposal | Final scope |
| Pricing | Fixed price possible |

### Actions Needed

1. Validate scope with all stakeholders
2. Finalize proposal
3. Begin implementation planning
4. Close

## Clarity Level Progression

```
Vague → Exploring → Defined → Scoped
  │         │          │         │
  │         │          │         └─→ Ready to close
  │         │          └─→ Ready for proposal
  │         └─→ Need scoping sessions
  └─→ Need extensive discovery
```

### Typical Progression Timeline

| From | To | Typical Time |
|------|-----|--------------|
| Vague | Exploring | 2-4 weeks |
| Exploring | Defined | 1-2 weeks |
| Defined | Scoped | 1 week |

### Accelerating Progression

| Technique | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Discovery workshop | Vague → Defined in one session |
| Case study review | Exploring → Defined quickly |
| Requirements template | Defined → Scoped efficiently |
| Pilot proposal | Skip to Scoped with limited scope |

## Red Flags by Level

### Vague Level Red Flags

- After multiple meetings, still vague → May never close
- Changes direction repeatedly → Not serious
- "Let's start and figure it out" → Recipe for failure

### Exploring Level Red Flags

- Scope keeps expanding → Never gets defined
- Too many stakeholders with different ideas → No consensus
- "All of the above" responses → Can't prioritize

### Defined Level Red Flags

- Key stakeholder hasn't seen scope → May derail
- Success criteria not agreed → Failure risk
- Technical constraints unknown → Implementation risk

### Scoped Level Red Flags

- Scope locked before technical validation → May be infeasible
- Timeline unrealistic for scope → Will slip
- Budget doesn't match scope → Scope cut coming

## Assessment Checklist

### Specificity Questions

- [ ] What exactly will be automated?
- [ ] Which interactions/processes?
- [ ] Which channels (chat, email, voice)?
- [ ] Which users (customer, internal)?
- [ ] What volume?

### Scope Questions

- [ ] What's in scope?
- [ ] What's explicitly out of scope?
- [ ] What's phase 1 vs. future?
- [ ] What dependencies exist?
- [ ] Who needs to agree on scope?

### Success Criteria Questions

- [ ] How will success be measured?
- [ ] What are the target metrics?
- [ ] What's the current baseline?
- [ ] Over what time period?
- [ ] Who decides if it's successful?
