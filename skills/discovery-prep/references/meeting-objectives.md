## Pre-Meeting Checklist

### For Each Objective

- [ ] Is it clear what success looks like?
- [ ] What questions will get me there?
- [ ] What might prevent achieving it?
- [ ] Do I have a fallback if blocked?

### Example

**Objective:** Confirm use case scope

**Success looks like:** They verbally confirm "We want to automate returns, exchanges, and order status inquiries on chat first"

**Questions to get there:**
1. "What specific interactions would you want automated?"
2. "What channels should we focus on?"
3. "What's in scope for phase 1?"

**What might block:**
- They don't know yet
- Multiple stakeholders disagree

**Fallback:**
- Propose we define scope together
- Schedule separate scope workshop

## During Meeting

### Tracking Progress

Mentally check off objectives as you achieve them.

If running low on time:
1. Prioritize remaining "Must" objectives
2. Sacrifice "Nice to Have" items
3. Be explicit: "Before we run out of time, I want to make sure..."

### When Objective Isn't Met

**In the meeting:**
- Ask follow-up questions
- Try different angle
- Be direct: "I want to make sure I understand X"

**After the meeting:**
- Note what's missing
- Follow up via email/call
- Address in next meeting
