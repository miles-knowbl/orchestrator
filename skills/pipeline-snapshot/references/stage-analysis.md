# Stage Analysis Reference

How to analyze pipeline by stage.

## Stage Health Indicators

### Lead Stage

**Healthy signs:**
- Steady inflow of new leads
- Quick qualification (5-10 days)
- Clear next steps for each lead

**Warning signs:**
- No new leads
- Leads aging without action
- Low conversion to Target

**Key metrics:**
- New leads this period
- Days in stage
- Lead → Target conversion

### Target Stage

**Healthy signs:**
- Active engagement
- Discovery meetings scheduled
- Champion identified

**Warning signs:**
- No response to outreach
- Multiple attempts, no meeting
- Stuck without discovery

**Key metrics:**
- Response rate
- Meeting scheduled rate
- Target → Discovery conversion

### Discovery Stage

**Healthy signs:**
- Multiple stakeholders engaged
- Use case defined
- Budget/timeline confirmed
- Moving toward proposal

**Warning signs:**
- Single contact only
- Vague requirements
- No budget discussion
- Stalled without proposal

**Key metrics:**
- Days in discovery
- Stakeholder count
- Use case clarity score
- Discovery → Contracting conversion

### Contracting Stage

**Healthy signs:**
- Active negotiation
- Legal engaged
- Timeline to signature
- Issues being resolved

**Warning signs:**
- No response to proposal
- Legal delays
- New objections appearing
- Timeline slipping

**Key metrics:**
- Days since proposal
- Open issues count
- Turn-around times
- Contracting → Production conversion

### Production Stage

**Healthy signs:**
- Pilot in progress
- Metrics tracking
- Stakeholders engaged
- Path to close clear

**Warning signs:**
- Pilot stalled
- Metrics not met
- Stakeholder disengagement
- Scope creep

**Key metrics:**
- Pilot success metrics
- Days to decision
- Production → Closed-Won conversion

## Stage Distribution Analysis

### Funnel Shape

**Healthy funnel:**
```
Lead:        ████████████ (30%)
Target:      ████████ (20%)
Discovery:   ██████ (25%)
Contracting: ████ (15%)
Production:  ██ (10%)
```

Wide at top, narrow at bottom.

**Unhealthy patterns:**

**Inverted funnel:**
```
Lead:        ██ (10%)
Discovery:   ████████ (40%)
Contracting: ████████ (40%)
```
Problem: Not enough new pipeline.

**Bottleneck:**
```
Lead:        ████████ (20%)
Target:      ████████████████ (40%)
Discovery:   ████ (10%)
```
Problem: Can't convert Target to Discovery.

### Stage Balance

| Stage | Ideal % of Deals | Ideal % of Value |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Lead | 25-35% | 15-25% |
| Target | 15-25% | 15-20% |
| Discovery | 20-30% | 25-35% |
| Contracting | 10-20% | 20-30% |
| Production | 5-10% | 10-15% |

## Stage Transition Analysis

### Healthy Transitions

| Transition | Healthy Rate | Below This = Problem |
|------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Lead → Target | 40%+ | <25% |
| Target → Discovery | 50%+ | <30% |
| Discovery → Contracting | 40%+ | <25% |
| Contracting → Production | 70%+ | <50% |
| Production → Closed-Won | 85%+ | <70% |

### Analyzing Low Conversion

**Lead → Target low:**
- Poor lead quality
- Insufficient outreach
- Wrong value proposition

**Target → Discovery low:**
- No champion development
- Not reaching decision makers
- Poor discovery preparation

**Discovery → Contracting low:**
- Unclear use case
- Budget not confirmed
- Technical concerns unaddressed

**Contracting → Production low:**
- Legal issues
- Pricing objections
- Internal approval problems

**Production → Closed-Won low:**
- Pilot failure
- Scope mismatch
- Champion loss

## Stage Duration Benchmarks

| Stage | Target Duration | Action at |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Lead | 7-14 days | 21+ days |
| Target | 14-21 days | 35+ days |
| Discovery | 21-45 days | 60+ days |
| Contracting | 14-30 days | 45+ days |
| Production | 30-60 days | 90+ days |

### Stalled Deal Thresholds

| Stage | Stalled if no movement for |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Lead | 14 days |
| Target | 21 days |
| Discovery | 30 days |
| Contracting | 21 days |
| Production | 45 days |

## Stage-Specific Actions

### For Stalled Leads

1. Try different outreach method
2. Try different contact
3. Qualify out if no progress

### For Stalled Targets

1. Direct phone outreach
2. Executive outreach
3. Referral approach
4. Qualify out if no meeting

### For Stalled Discovery

1. Identify specific blocker
2. Create urgency
3. Executive engagement
4. Consider stage regression

### For Stalled Contracting

1. Address specific issue
2. Escalate internally
3. Champion pressure
4. Reduce scope to close

### For Stalled Production

1. Review pilot metrics
2. Address concerns directly
3. Executive meeting
4. Extend if showing value

## Stage Movement Tracking

### Forward Movement

Track when deals move forward:
- Which deals
- How long in previous stage
- What triggered movement

### Backward Movement

Track when deals regress:
- Which deals
- Why (lost champion, budget cut, etc.)
- What stage they went to

### Stage Skipping

Some deals skip stages:
- Lead → Discovery (inbound with clear need)
- Target → Contracting (returning customer)

Track separately — different conversion expectations.

## Stage Health Score

Calculate health per stage:

```
Stage Health = (Avg Deal Health) × (1 - Stalled %)
```

| Stage | Avg Health | Stalled % | Stage Health |
|-------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Lead | 45 | 20% | 36 |
| Target | 55 | 15% | 47 |
| Discovery | 72 | 10% | 65 |
| Contracting | 82 | 5% | 78 |
| Production | 88 | 0% | 88 |

Lower stage health = more attention needed.
