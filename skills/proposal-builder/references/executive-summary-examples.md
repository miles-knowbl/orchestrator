# Executive Summary Examples

The executive summary is the most-read section of any proposal. Many decision-makers read only this section before deciding whether to continue.

## Anatomy of an Effective Executive Summary

Every strong executive summary contains these five elements in order:

| Element | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Hook** | Connect to the client's stated problem or goal | 1-2 sentences |
| **Context** | Show you understand their situation | 2-3 sentences |
| **Solution** | State what you propose | 2-3 sentences |
| **Outcome** | Quantify the expected result | 1-2 sentences |
| **Call to confidence** | Why you are the right choice | 1 sentence |

**Target length:** 150-250 words. Never exceed 300.

**Key rule:** The reader should understand the entire proposal from this section alone.

## Example 1: Platform Migration (Technology)

> Acme Corp's legacy order management system processes 12,000 daily transactions but cannot scale to meet projected 40% growth over the next 18 months. Downtime incidents have increased 3x year-over-year, directly impacting revenue.
>
> We propose migrating Acme's order management to a cloud-native architecture on AWS, executed in three phases over 16 weeks. The migration preserves all existing integrations while introducing auto-scaling, automated failover, and real-time monitoring.
>
> This investment of $185,000 is projected to eliminate $420,000 in annual downtime costs and support transaction volumes up to 5x current capacity. Our team has completed 14 similar migrations for logistics companies in the past two years, including a comparable project for [Reference Client].

**Why it works:** Leads with the client's numbers, quantifies the problem, and anchors ROI against investment.

## Example 2: Process Improvement (Consulting)

> Your customer onboarding process currently takes an average of 23 days from signed contract to first value delivery. Exit interviews show that 31% of churned customers cite slow onboarding as a factor.
>
> We will redesign the onboarding workflow through a structured assessment and implementation engagement, targeting a reduction to under 10 days. Our approach combines process mapping, automation of manual handoffs, and a self-service portal for common setup tasks.
>
> Based on your current churn rate and average contract value, reducing onboarding time to under 10 days is projected to retain an additional $1.2M in annual revenue. We have delivered similar results for three SaaS companies in the $10-50M ARR range.

**Why it works:** Uses the client's own data, ties the problem to a business outcome (churn), and provides a concrete target.

## Example 3: Brand Strategy (Creative)

> As [Client] expands from B2B industrial markets into direct-to-consumer channels, the current brand identity -- built for procurement committees -- does not resonate with individual buyers. Your pilot DTC campaign achieved a 0.4% conversion rate, well below the 2.1% industry benchmark.
>
> We propose a brand evolution engagement that repositions [Client] for consumer audiences while preserving the technical credibility that drives your B2B pipeline. Deliverables include a refreshed visual identity, messaging framework, and launch campaign for the DTC channel.
>
> This $72,000 engagement is designed to close the conversion gap within two quarters. Our consumer brand work for [Reference Client] achieved a 3.1x improvement in conversion rate within 90 days of launch.

**Why it works:** Acknowledges the dual-audience challenge, preserves what works, and provides a relevant case study.

## Example 4: Staff Augmentation (Services)

> Your engineering team needs to ship the payments integration by Q3 to meet the enterprise sales pipeline commitment, but the current team lacks Stripe Connect expertise and is already at capacity on the mobile release.
>
> We will embed two senior engineers with Stripe Connect experience into your team for 12 weeks. They will own the payments integration end-to-end, working within your existing codebase, sprint cadence, and code review process.
>
> At a blended rate of $185/hour, the total investment is approximately $88,800. This avoids the 4-6 month timeline and $40-60K cost of recruiting permanent hires for a finite scope of work.

**Why it works:** Speaks to urgency, positions against the alternative (hiring), and frames the cost as savings.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| **The autobiography** | Opens with "Founded in 2005, we are a leading..." | Open with the client's problem, not your story |
| **The fog** | Vague language: "leverage synergies to drive transformation" | Use specific numbers and concrete nouns |
| **The novel** | Exceeds 300 words, buries the point | Cut to 200 words; move details to later sections |
| **The mirror** | Restates the RFP requirements back verbatim | Add insight the client does not already have |
| **The premature ask** | Leads with price before establishing value | Place investment after outcome |
| **No hook** | Starts with "This proposal outlines..." | Start with a fact about the client's situation |
