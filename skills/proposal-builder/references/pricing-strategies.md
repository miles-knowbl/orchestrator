# Pricing Strategies

Selecting the right pricing model and framing it effectively are distinct skills. This reference covers both.

## Pricing Models

### Fixed Price

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Structure** | Single total price for defined scope |
| **Best when** | Scope is clear, requirements are stable, you have done similar work before |
| **Risk** | Seller bears scope risk; underestimation erodes margin |
| **Client appeal** | Budget certainty, simple approval process |

**Tip:** Add a 15-25% buffer for unknowns. Define change request process explicitly.

### Time and Materials (T&M)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Structure** | Hourly/daily rate x actual hours worked |
| **Best when** | Scope is uncertain, discovery is needed, ongoing work |
| **Risk** | Client bears cost risk; requires trust and transparency |
| **Client appeal** | Pay only for work done, flexibility to change direction |

**Tip:** Offer a rate card with weekly caps or "not-to-exceed" ceiling to reduce client anxiety.

### Value-Based

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Structure** | Price tied to business outcome or value delivered |
| **Best when** | Outcome is measurable, value significantly exceeds cost, strong client trust |
| **Risk** | Requires accurate value estimation; may involve performance guarantees |
| **Client appeal** | Aligned incentives, pays for results not effort |

**Tip:** Requires a discovery phase to quantify value. Price at 10-20% of projected value delivered.

### Retainer

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Structure** | Fixed monthly fee for ongoing availability or capacity |
| **Best when** | Ongoing need, relationship-based work, advisory roles |
| **Risk** | Underutilization (client) or overutilization (seller) |
| **Client appeal** | Predictable cost, guaranteed availability, priority access |

**Tip:** Define monthly hour bands (e.g., "includes up to 40 hours") with rollover or overage terms.

### Phased

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Structure** | Break engagement into priced phases with go/no-go gates |
| **Best when** | Large scope, new client relationship, high uncertainty |
| **Risk** | Client may not proceed past early phases |
| **Client appeal** | Lower initial commitment, ability to evaluate before continuing |

**Tip:** Price Phase 1 (discovery/assessment) to be valuable standalone. This builds trust for subsequent phases.

## Model Selection Matrix

| Situation | Recommended Model |
|-----------|------------------|
| Clear scope, competitive bid | Fixed Price |
| Unclear scope, exploration needed | T&M with cap |
| High measurable ROI | Value-Based |
| Ongoing relationship, variable demand | Retainer |
| New client, large engagement | Phased (fixed per phase) |
| Staff augmentation | T&M or Retainer |
| Urgent timeline, premium expected | Fixed Price (premium) |

## Framing Techniques

### Anchoring
Present the highest-value option first. The client evaluates subsequent options relative to the anchor.

```
Option A (Comprehensive): $150,000
Option B (Standard):       $95,000   <-- target
Option C (Essential):      $55,000
```

Most clients choose the middle option. Make the middle option the one you want to sell.

### Contrast Framing
Compare your price against the cost of the problem, not against competitors.

| Instead of | Say |
|-----------|-----|
| "Our price is $80K" | "This $80K investment addresses the $400K annual cost of [problem]" |
| "We charge $200/hour" | "At $200/hour, the full engagement costs less than one month of the current inefficiency" |

### Bundling
Group services to obscure individual line-item scrutiny and increase perceived value.

- Bundle deliverables into phases rather than listing hourly breakdowns
- Include "bonus" items that cost you little but add perceived value (documentation, training, 30-day support)

### Investment Language
Frame price as investment, not cost. Connect every dollar to an outcome.

| Cost language | Investment language |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "The project costs $120K" | "The total investment is $120K" |
| "Phase 2 is $45K" | "Phase 2, which delivers [outcome], is $45K" |
| "Our rate is $200/hr" | "Senior engineers with [specialty] expertise are $200/hr" |

## Common Pricing Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| **Race to bottom** | Competing on price alone | Differentiate on value, methodology, or risk reduction |
| **Hourly only** | Caps your earnings at hours x rate | Shift to value-based or fixed price as you gain expertise |
| **Hidden costs** | Expenses, revisions, or tools appear later | Disclose all costs upfront; include assumptions |
| **No options** | Single price is a take-it-or-leave-it | Offer 2-3 options at different scope/price levels |
| **Discounting first** | Giving discounts before being asked | Discount only in exchange for something (longer term, referral, case study) |
| **Round numbers** | $100,000 feels arbitrary | Use specific numbers ($97,500) to signal calculation behind the price |
| **Price without context** | Stating price before establishing value | Always present value/outcome before investment section |

## Payment Terms Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|------------|
| 50/50 (upfront / completion) | Small to mid engagements, new clients |
| 40/30/30 (start / mid / end) | Multi-phase projects, 2-4 month duration |
| Monthly invoicing | Retainer and T&M engagements |
| Milestone-based | Large fixed-price projects with clear gates |
| Net 30 | Established enterprise clients with procurement |

**Cash flow tip:** Always collect at least 25% before starting work. This qualifies commitment and funds initial effort.
