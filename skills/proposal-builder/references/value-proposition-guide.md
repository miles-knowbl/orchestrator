# Value Proposition Guide

A value proposition is the bridge between the client's problem and your solution. This guide provides frameworks for building and articulating compelling value.

## Value Proposition Canvas

Map what the client needs against what you offer.

```
CLIENT SIDE                         YOUR SIDE
+-------------------------+        +-------------------------+
| Jobs to be done         |        | Products & Services     |
| - [Functional jobs]     |  <-->  | - [What you deliver]    |
| - [Emotional jobs]      |        |                         |
| - [Social jobs]         |        | Gain Creators           |
|                         |        | - [How you create value]|
| Pains                   |  <-->  |                         |
| - [Frustrations]        |        | Pain Relievers          |
| - [Risks]               |        | - [How you remove pain] |
| - [Obstacles]           |        |                         |
|                         |        |                         |
| Gains                   |  <-->  |                         |
| - [Desired outcomes]    |        |                         |
| - [Expected benefits]   |        |                         |
+-------------------------+        +-------------------------+
```

**Process:** Fill in the client side first (from discovery), then map your offerings to each element.

## TPSOD Framework

Structure your value proposition using five components.

| Component | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Target** | Who is this for? | "Mid-market SaaS companies scaling past $10M ARR" |
| **Problem** | What specific problem do they face? | "Manual billing reconciliation takes 40 hours/month and produces 5% error rates" |
| **Solution** | What do you propose? | "Automated reconciliation engine integrated with your existing ERP" |
| **Outcome** | What measurable result? | "Reduce reconciliation to 2 hours/month with 99.8% accuracy" |
| **Differentiator** | Why you over alternatives? | "Pre-built connectors for NetSuite and Stripe; live in 4 weeks, not 4 months" |

**One-sentence formula:**
"For [Target] who [Problem], we deliver [Solution] that achieves [Outcome], unlike alternatives because [Differentiator]."

## Quantifying Value

Proposals with quantified value close at 2-3x the rate of those without. Use these methods.

### ROI Calculation

```
ROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment x 100

Example:
  Gain: $400K annual savings from process automation
  Cost: $120K engagement
  ROI:  ($400K - $120K) / $120K x 100 = 233%
```

Present as: "For every $1 invested, this engagement returns $3.33."

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

Compare the full cost of your solution against alternatives over 3 years.

| Cost Element | Current State | Proposed Solution |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Initial investment | $0 (status quo) | $120,000 |
| Annual maintenance | $180,000 | $24,000 |
| Staffing (FTEs) | $260,000/yr | $130,000/yr |
| Downtime cost | $90,000/yr | $5,000/yr |
| **3-Year Total** | **$1,590,000** | **$597,000** |

### Time Savings

Convert time saved into dollars using loaded labor cost.

```
Hours saved/week x Loaded hourly rate x 52 weeks = Annual value

Example:
  15 hrs/week x $75/hr x 52 = $58,500/year
```

### Risk Reduction

Quantify the cost of the risk your solution mitigates.

```
Risk value = Probability of event x Cost of event

Example:
  30% chance of data breach x $2M breach cost = $600K risk exposure
  Solution reduces probability to 5% = $100K risk exposure
  Value of risk reduction = $500K
```

## Industry-Specific Value Examples

### Technology / SaaS
- **Revenue:** "Reduce time-to-market by 6 weeks, capturing $X in earlier revenue"
- **Cost:** "Automate X process, eliminating Y FTE-hours per month"
- **Risk:** "Achieve SOC 2 compliance, unblocking enterprise pipeline worth $X"

### Financial Services
- **Revenue:** "Faster loan processing increases throughput by X applications/month"
- **Cost:** "Reduce compliance reporting effort from X days to Y hours"
- **Risk:** "Automated audit trails reduce regulatory penalty exposure by $X"

### Healthcare
- **Revenue:** "Reduce claim denial rate from X% to Y%, recovering $Z annually"
- **Cost:** "Automate patient intake, saving X staff hours per week"
- **Risk:** "HIPAA-compliant architecture eliminates $X in potential breach fines"

### Manufacturing
- **Revenue:** "Predictive maintenance reduces unplanned downtime by X%, adding $Y in output"
- **Cost:** "Inventory optimization reduces carrying costs by $X per quarter"
- **Risk:** "Quality monitoring reduces defect rate from X% to Y%"

## Value Articulation Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|------------|
| **Use their numbers** | Reference data from discovery, not industry averages |
| **Show the delta** | Always compare before and after, not just the after state |
| **Make it annual** | Annual figures are more impressive than monthly |
| **Attribute conservatively** | Under-promise on value; credibility matters more than big numbers |
| **Stack the value** | List multiple value sources; total is more compelling than any single item |
| **Time-bound the gain** | "Within 90 days" is more credible than an open-ended promise |

## Value Stacking Template

Structure the ROI section around three dimensions: **Cost Reduction** (savings items with annual amounts), **Revenue Impact** (revenue items with annual amounts), and **Risk Mitigation** (reduced exposure amounts). Close with: Total Projected Annual Value, Investment, and Payback Period.
