## Common Review Mistakes

### Mistake: Skipping the Review

**Why it happens:** "Too busy"

**Fix:** Block 30-60 min Friday, protect it

### Mistake: Only Looking Back

**Why it happens:** Focus on what happened
**Impact:** Not ready for next week
**Fix:** 50% back, 50% forward

### Mistake: Too High-Level

**Why it happens:** Generic reflection
**Impact:** No actionable insights
**Fix:** Be specific — which deal, which action

### Mistake: Not Updating Systems

**Why it happens:** Review in head only
**Impact:** Deal files outdated
**Fix:** Update files as part of review

### Mistake: Beating Yourself Up

**Why it happens:** Focus on misses
**Impact:** Demoralizing
**Fix:** Balance: what worked + what to improve
