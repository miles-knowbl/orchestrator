## Signal Interpretation Guidelines

### Strong Signals (High Confidence)

- Direct statements about AI experience
- Named tools, vendors, or projects
- Specific metrics or outcomes
- Job titles (Data Scientist, ML Engineer, Chief AI Officer)

### Moderate Signals (Medium Confidence)

- Implied experience from question quality
- References to data capabilities
- Process maturity indicators
- Budget discussions

### Weak Signals (Low Confidence)

- Company size (larger ≠ more mature)
- Industry (tech ≠ more mature)
- Enthusiasm (interest ≠ capability)
- Timeline pressure (urgency ≠ readiness)

## Probing Questions

When signals unclear, ask:

**Experience:**
- "Have you implemented AI solutions before?"
- "What AI tools are you currently using?"
- "What did you learn from past AI projects?"

**Capability:**
- "Do you have data science resources?"
- "Where does your training data live?"
- "What's your current tech stack?"

**Strategy:**
- "Is there executive sponsorship for AI?"
- "Where does this fit in your priorities?"
- "Is there dedicated budget for this?"

**Readiness:**
- "What would make this successful for you?"
- "Who would be involved in implementation?"
- "What's your change management approach?"
