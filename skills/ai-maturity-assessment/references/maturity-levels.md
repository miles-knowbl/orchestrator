# AI Maturity Levels Reference

Framework for assessing organizational AI maturity.

## Level 1: No Experience

**Definition:** Organization has never implemented AI/ML. This is their first consideration.

### Signals

- "First time looking at AI"
- "Don't know where to start"
- "What is AI anyway?"
- No AI-related roles in organization
- No data science function
- Questions suggest fundamental confusion

### Sales Implications

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Education | High — need to build understanding |
| Sales Cycle | Longer — building from zero |
| Risk Level | Higher — no organizational learning |
| Pricing | Standard — can't compare to alternatives |
| Support | More hand-holding required |

### Best Approach

- Lead with business outcomes, not AI features
- Provide extensive education
- Set realistic expectations
- Offer managed/turnkey solutions
- Plan for longer implementation

---

## Level 2: Exploring

**Definition:** Actively researching AI options. Learning but hasn't implemented.

### Signals

- "Researching options"
- "Just learning"
- "Evaluating different approaches"
- Attended AI conferences/webinars
- Reading case studies
- Asking informed questions
- May have formed AI committee

### Sales Implications

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Education | Medium — some foundation exists |
| Sales Cycle | Standard — ready to evaluate |
| Risk Level | Medium — aware but inexperienced |
| Pricing | Comparison shopping likely |
| Support | Standard support needs |

### Best Approach

- Accelerate their learning
- Differentiate from competitors
- Provide proof points (case studies)
- Help them build internal case
- Offer pilot/POC options

---

## Level 3: Attempted

**Definition:** Has tried AI before. May have succeeded or failed.

### Signals

- "Tried [tool/vendor] before"
- "Had a POC that didn't work out"
- "Built something in-house"
- "We used to have [AI tool]"
- References to past AI projects
- Lessons learned discussions

### Sales Implications

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Education | Low — they know the space |
| Sales Cycle | Variable — depends on past experience |
| Risk Level | Medium — battle scars inform decisions |
| Pricing | Sophisticated — know what they're buying |
| Support | Clear expectations from experience |

### Best Approach

**If past attempt failed:**
- Understand what went wrong
- Address those specific concerns
- Show how you're different
- Offer safeguards against repeat failure

**If past attempt succeeded:**
- Build on their foundation
- Show how you extend what they have
- Reference their existing knowledge
- Move faster through basics

---

## Level 4: Deployed

**Definition:** Currently using AI in production. Has operational experience.

### Signals

- "Using [tool] for [use case]"
- "Our AI system currently..."
- "We have an AI team"
- "Our models do..."
- Discuss model performance metrics
- Reference production AI challenges

### Sales Implications

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Education | None — they're educated |
| Sales Cycle | Faster — know what they want |
| Risk Level | Lower — organizational capability exists |
| Pricing | Sophisticated, ROI-focused |
| Support | High expectations, technical depth |

### Best Approach

- Skip basics, go deep
- Technical proof points
- Integration focus
- Performance benchmarks
- ROI vs. current solution

---

## Level 5: Mature

**Definition:** AI-first organization. Multiple AI systems, AI strategy, dedicated teams.

### Signals

- "Multiple AI systems in production"
- "AI-first strategy"
- "Our AI platform..."
- Chief AI Officer or equivalent
- AI/ML is core differentiator
- Build vs. buy sophisticated analysis

### Sales Implications

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Education | None — they may educate you |
| Sales Cycle | Fast if good fit, no deal if not |
| Risk Level | Low — sophisticated buyer |
| Pricing | Volume/enterprise, complex deals |
| Support | Enterprise SLAs, technical depth |

### Best Approach

- Peer-level technical discussions
- Enterprise capabilities
- API/integration focus
- Custom solutions
- Strategic partnership positioning

## Maturity Level Matrix

| Aspect | No Experience | Exploring | Attempted | Deployed | Mature |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| AI Team | None | Maybe committee | May have had | Yes | Substantial |
| Data Science | None | None/1 person | Some | Team | Centers of excellence |
| Infrastructure | None | None | Maybe partial | Production-ready | Platform |
| AI Strategy | None | Informal | Emerging | Formal | Core to business |
| Past Projects | None | Research only | 1-2 attempts | Multiple live | Many live |
| Expectations | Unclear | Building | Informed | Clear | Sophisticated |

## Progression Patterns

### Typical Progression

```
No Experience → Exploring → Attempted → Deployed → Mature
     ↑              ↑            ↑
     |              |            |
   (Trigger)    (Decision)   (Success)
```

### Failed Attempt Loops

```
Exploring → Attempted (Failed) → Back to Exploring
                   ↓
              Skeptical of AI
```

### Accelerated Paths

```
No Experience → Acquired company with AI → Deployed
               → Hired AI leadership → Exploring/Deployed
               → Major competitive pressure → Fast-track all levels
```

## Assessment Confidence

| Confidence | Basis |
|------------|-------|
| High | Multiple explicit signals, direct statements |
| Medium | Some signals, reasonable inference |
| Low | Limited data, primarily assumption |

Always note confidence level and seek more signals when low.
