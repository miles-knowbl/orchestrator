## Signal Strength

| Signal Type | Weight |
|-------------|--------|
| Explicit verbal statement | Highest |
| Repeated behavior pattern | High |
| Single behavior | Medium |
| Written tone | Medium |
| Inferred from context | Low |

## Assessment Process

1. **Gather all signals** from recent interactions
2. **Weigh signals** by strength
3. **Look for patterns** (one-off vs. consistent)
4. **Consider context** (bad day vs. true sentiment)
5. **Assign sentiment** with confidence level

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Reading too much into one signal | Look for patterns |
| Assuming enthusiasm = support | Watch for action, not just words |
| Ignoring subtle skepticism | Address early |
| Projecting your feelings | Base on evidence only |
| Not updating sentiment | Re-assess with new data |
