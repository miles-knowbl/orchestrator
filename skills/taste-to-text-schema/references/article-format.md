# Article Format Guide

An article is a unified piece of writing that develops an idea in depth. Every article comes with a companion micro-post for sharing.

## Length Guidelines

| Length | Word Count | Read Time | Best For |
|--------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Short** | <800 | 3-4 min | Single insight, opinion piece, quick how-to |
| **Medium** | 800-2,500 | 5-10 min | Developed argument, story, framework |
| **Long** | 2,500+ | 10+ min | Comprehensive guide, deep dive, research |

## The Companion Micro-Post

Every article needs a micro-post that:
- Works in ≤140 characters
- Creates curiosity to click through
- Includes link placeholder `[LINK]`
- Captures the article's essence

**Companion Post Patterns:**

| Pattern | Example Shape |
|---------|---------------|
| **Thesis tease** | "The biggest mistake in [domain]: [insight]. [LINK]" |
| **Question + answer promise** | "Why does [phenomenon]? I spent [time] finding out. [LINK]" |
| **Listicle hook** | "[N] [things] that [benefit]. My favorites: [LINK]" |
| **Story tease** | "[Time reference], [event]. What I learned: [LINK]" |
| **Bold claim** | "[Contrarian statement]. Here's my case: [LINK]" |

**Density Rules:**
Same as thread hooks—every word earns its place. Meaning-dense vocabulary. Cut ruthlessly.

## Headlines

The headline must:
- Capture the article's core value proposition
- Work in <15 words (ideally <10)
- Be specific enough to set expectations
- Be intriguing enough to earn the click

**Headline Patterns:**

| Pattern | Structure | Example Shape |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **How-to** | How to [achieve outcome] | "How to Write Headlines That Convert" |
| **List** | [N] [things] for [outcome] | "7 Frameworks for Clearer Thinking" |
| **Question** | Why/What/How [curiosity gap] | "Why Your Best Ideas Come in the Shower" |
| **Declarative** | [Bold statement] | "Strategy Is Just Focused Saying No" |
| **Guide** | The [Complete/Essential] Guide to X | "The Complete Guide to Thread Writing" |

**Subheadlines (optional):**
Expand on the headline. Add context, specify audience, or amplify the hook.

```
Headline: "The 3-Hour Rule"
Subheadline: "How I stopped working 12-hour days and got more done"
```

## Introduction

The intro must:
- Hook the reader in the first 1-2 sentences
- Establish stakes (why this matters)
- Preview the thesis without giving everything away
- Create momentum into the body

**Intro Length by Article Length:**
- Short articles: 1-2 paragraphs
- Medium articles: 2-3 paragraphs
- Long articles: 3-5 paragraphs

**Intro Patterns:**

| Pattern | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Anecdote** | Open with a story that illustrates the point |
| **Problem statement** | Name the pain the reader feels |
| **Surprising fact** | Lead with data that challenges assumptions |
| **Question** | Pose the question the article answers |
| **Contrarian hook** | State the conventional wisdom you'll challenge |

## Body Sections

Body development depends on the **Structure** dimension:

### Linear Structure
- No headers (or minimal)
- Flows as continuous prose
- Paragraphs build naturally on each other
- Good for: essays, narratives, short opinion pieces

### Sectioned Structure
- Clear headers for each section
- Scannable—reader can jump around
- Each section somewhat self-contained
- Good for: how-tos, guides, frameworks, long-form

### Narrative Structure
- Story arc (setup → conflict → resolution)
- May have headers or may flow linearly
- Temporal progression or tension arc
- Good for: case studies, personal essays, journey pieces

**Section Design:**

Each section needs:
- **section_id**: Unique identifier
- **section_type**: intro, body, conclusion, callout, aside
- **heading**: If sectioned structure
- **content_summary**: What it covers (for outline)
- **content_full**: The actual text
- **purpose**: What it accomplishes
- **voice_elements**: Which taste schema patterns appear

## Conclusion

The conclusion must:
- Synthesize (not just summarize)
- Land the core message definitively
- Give the reader a clear takeaway
- Include closer/CTA

**Conclusion Types:**

| Type | Function | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Synthesis** | Weave threads together into unified insight | Complex arguments, multi-part pieces |
| **Action CTA** | Direct the reader to do something specific | How-tos, frameworks, practical pieces |
| **Reflection** | Zoom out to broader meaning | Essays, narratives, thought pieces |
| **Callback** | Return to opening anecdote/hook | Story-driven pieces, symmetry-seeking |
| **Challenge** | Push reader to change behavior/thinking | Persuasive pieces, provocations |

## Pull Quotes

Pull quotes serve two purposes:
1. Visual break in longer articles (callout boxes)
2. Shareable snippets for social promotion

**Good pull quotes:**
- Stand completely alone
- Capture a core insight
- Sound quotable (rhythm, punch)
- Are ≤280 characters (tweetable)

**Pull quote quantity:**
- Short articles: 1-2
- Medium articles: 2-4
- Long articles: 4-6

## Applying Dimensions to Articles

### Structure Dimension

| Value | Article Expression |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Linear** | Continuous prose, minimal headers, essay-like flow |
| **Sectioned** | Clear headers, scannable, each section labeled and self-contained |
| **Narrative** | Story arc driving the structure, setup/conflict/resolution |

### Purpose Dimension

| Value | Article Approach |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Inform** | Explanatory, educational, facts-forward. Intro states topic, body explains, conclusion synthesizes. |
| **Persuade** | Argumentative, evidence-building. Intro states position, body makes case, conclusion reinforces. |
| **Teach** | Instructional, actionable. Intro promises utility, body delivers steps/frameworks, conclusion enables action. |
| **Provoke** | Challenging, reframing. Intro disrupts, body develops the challenge, conclusion leaves reader changed. |

### Audience Expertise Dimension

| Value | Article Calibration |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Novice** | Define terms, more context, slower development, explicit signposting |
| **General** | Balanced assumed knowledge, standard pacing, moderate depth |
| **Expert** | Dense, jargon accepted, fast pace, peer-to-peer, skip fundamentals |

### Evidence Style Dimension

| Value | Article Pattern |
|-------|----------------|
| **Data-driven** | Stats, research, citations. Numbers in intro, evidence throughout, data in pull quotes. |
| **Story-driven** | Anecdotes, case studies, examples. Story opens, stories illustrate points, story closes. |
| **Assertion** | Opinion, conviction, perspective. Position stated clearly, defended with logic, owned confidently. |

## Voice Alignment for Articles

Pull from taste schema:

**From `narrative_mechanics`:**
- Deploy arc types in narrative-structure articles
- Apply specificity anchors throughout (numbers, sensory details)
- Ground with proper nouns and references

**From `rhetorical_signature`:**
- Use explanatory analogies from their source domains
- Deploy humor with correct function and placement
- Apply contrarian inversions where the argument calls for it

**From `emotional_architecture`:**
- Vulnerability formula for personal content (specific + past + overcome)
- Pair triumphs with documented struggles
- Include gratitude with specific targets

**From `teaching_moves`:**
- Name frameworks (use their naming patterns)
- Structure advice inversions properly
- Match their pedagogical style

**From `audience_relationship`:**
- Open with their universal hook patterns
- Grant permissions in the conclusion
- Create intimacy moments where appropriate

**From `signature_phrases`:**
- Use their opening moves for intro options
- Apply their transition phrases between sections
- Echo their closing moves in conclusion

## Article Quality Checklist

Before finalizing:

☐ Companion micro-post works in ≤140 chars with [LINK]
☐ Headline is <15 words and specific
☐ Intro hooks within first 2 sentences
☐ Body structure matches chosen dimension
☐ Sections have clear purpose (no filler)
☐ Conclusion synthesizes and gives clear takeaway
☐ Pull quotes stand alone and are shareable
☐ Could be read aloud and sound like the voice
☐ Specificity present (numbers, names, details)
☐ Voice elements appear throughout, not just intro
