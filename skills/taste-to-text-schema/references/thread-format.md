# Thread Format Guide

A thread is a sequence of micro-posts that builds a cumulative argument, story, or explanation. Each post must work as an atomic unit while contributing to the whole.

## Thread Anatomy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ POST 1: Hook (the micro-post)       │ ← Grabs attention, creates curiosity
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ POST 2: Setup/Context               │ ← Establishes stakes or background  
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ POST 3-N: Development               │ ← Builds the argument/story
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ FINAL POST: Closer                  │ ← Lands the point, CTA
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Post Count Guidelines

| Length | Posts | Best For |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Short (3-5)** | Hook + 2-3 development + closer | Single insight, quick story, one framework |
| **Medium (6-10)** | Hook + 4-8 development + closer | Multi-point argument, detailed story, teaching |
| **Long (10+)** | Hook + 8+ development + closer | Comprehensive breakdown, epic story, deep dive |

## The Hook Micro-Post (Post 1)

The hook is the most important post. It must:
- Work in ≤140 characters (can expand to 280 if needed)
- Create enough curiosity to earn the click to expand
- Stand alone as a complete thought
- Signal what's coming without giving it all away

**Hook Patterns:**

| Pattern | Structure | Example Shape |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Contrarian** | Challenge conventional wisdom | "Most people think X. They're wrong. Here's why:" |
| **Curiosity gap** | Promise valuable insight | "I spent 10 years learning this. Sharing it in 5 posts:" |
| **Story tease** | Begin a narrative | "In 2019, I made a $50K mistake. Here's what it taught me:" |
| **List promise** | Enumerate what's coming | "7 lessons from building a $100M company:" |
| **Bold claim** | Assertive statement | "The best career advice I ever got was to quit." |

**Hook Density:**
Every word must earn its place. Use meaning-dense words—specific numbers, concrete nouns, active verbs. Cut filler ruthlessly.

```
❌ "I want to share some thoughts about something I learned"
✓ "I wasted 3 years on bad advice. The fix took 10 minutes:"
```

## Development Posts (Posts 2 to N-1)

Each development post should:
- Advance the argument/story by exactly one beat
- Begin with a transition that connects to the previous post
- End with enough momentum to pull into the next
- Be readable standalone (someone might screenshot just this one)

**Transition Patterns:**

| Type | Function | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Additive** | Building on prior point | "And it gets better...", "But that's not all." |
| **Contrastive** | Pivoting or complicating | "But here's the catch:", "The problem?" |
| **Causal** | Showing consequence | "So what happened?", "The result:" |
| **Temporal** | Moving through time | "Three months later...", "Fast forward to 2023:" |
| **Enumerative** | Listing/numbering | "First:", "Lesson #3:", "Step 2:" |

**Post Rhythm:**
Vary post length and structure. A thread of identical-length posts feels robotic.

```
Post 2: Medium length setup (200 chars)
Post 3: Short punchy point (80 chars)
Post 4: Longer development (280 chars)
Post 5: Another short beat (100 chars)
Post 6: Medium closer (180 chars)
```

## The Closer (Final Post)

The closer must:
- Resolve the thread's tension/curiosity
- Give the reader something to do, think, or feel
- Be memorable (this is what gets screenshotted with "this 🔥")

**Closer Types:**

| Type | Function | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **CTA** | Direct action request | When you want engagement, follows, shares |
| **Reflection** | Synthesize the takeaway | When the insight is the point |
| **Callback** | Return to hook | When symmetry strengthens the message |
| **Open question** | Invite reader thinking | When you want discussion |
| **Challenge** | Push reader to act | When behavior change is the goal |

## Applying Dimensions to Threads

### Structure Dimension

| Value | Thread Expression |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Linear** | Sequential flow, each post follows naturally from prior, minimal jumping around |
| **Sectioned** | Clear groupings (e.g., "Part 1: The Problem", "Part 2: The Solution"), explicit transitions |
| **Narrative** | Story arc with setup/conflict/resolution, temporal flow, character/scene |

### Purpose Dimension

| Value | Thread Approach |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Inform** | Facts, data, explanations. Hook promises knowledge, closer synthesizes. |
| **Persuade** | Argument building, evidence stacking. Hook states position, closer reinforces. |
| **Teach** | Step-by-step, frameworks, actionable. Hook promises utility, closer enables action. |
| **Provoke** | Challenge, question, reframe. Hook disrupts, closer leaves reader changed. |

### Audience Expertise Dimension

| Value | Thread Calibration |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Novice** | Define terms, more context posts, slower build, explicit connections |
| **General** | Some assumed knowledge, balanced pace, moderate density |
| **Expert** | Dense, jargon okay, faster pace, skip basics, peer-to-peer tone |

### Evidence Style Dimension

| Value | Thread Pattern |
|-------|---------------|
| **Data-driven** | Numbers, stats, research. Posts cite evidence, hook may lead with surprising stat. |
| **Story-driven** | Narrative, examples, case studies. Posts advance story, hook teases the story. |
| **Assertion** | Opinion, perspective, conviction. Posts state positions, hook makes bold claim. |

## Voice Alignment for Threads

Pull from taste schema:

**From `narrative_mechanics`:**
- Use the voice's arc types if telling a story
- Apply specificity anchors (exact numbers, sensory details)
- Use signature proper nouns and references

**From `rhetorical_signature`:**
- Deploy analogies from their source domains
- Apply humor with correct function and timing
- Use contrarian inversions where natural

**From `emotional_architecture`:**
- Vulnerability formula (specific + past + overcome)
- Earned victories paired with struggle
- Gratitude with specific targets

**From `audience_relationship`:**
- Universal hooks in their language
- Permission grants in the closer
- Parasocial intimacy where appropriate

**From `signature_phrases`:**
- Use their opening moves for hook variants
- Apply their transition phrases between posts
- Echo their closing moves in the closer

## Thread Quality Checklist

Before finalizing:

☐ Hook works in ≤140 chars and creates curiosity
☐ Each post advances by exactly one beat
☐ Transitions connect posts (no orphan posts)
☐ Post lengths vary (not all same length)
☐ Closer resolves the thread and gives reader something
☐ Could be read aloud and sound like the voice
☐ Specificity present (numbers, names, details)
☐ At least one signature voice element per 3 posts
