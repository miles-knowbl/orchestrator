- Backburner: 1.5-2 hours (5%)

### Per-Deal Effort Guidelines

| Focus | 3-6 hours | Daily attention |
| Maintain | 1-3 hours | 2-3x per week |

- Proposal work

### Discovery Stage

**Typical effort:** 3-5 hours/week

**Focus on:**

**This is where most time goes.**

## Capacity Planning

### Deal Capacity by Stage

With 40 hours/week selling time:

| Stage | Max Active Deals | Rationale |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Lead | 20-30 | Low effort each |
| Target | 10-15 | Some effort to convert |
| Discovery | 5-8 | High effort |
| Contracting | 3-5 | Time-sensitive |
| Production | 2-3 | Monitoring |

**Total active deals:** 40-60

### Focus Tier Capacity

Maximum Focus tier deals: 5-7

Why:
- Each needs 3-6 hrs/week
- 5-7 × 4 hrs = 20-28 hours
- Leaves time for other tiers

---

## Weekly Planning

### Monday Planning (30 min)

1. Review priority list
2. Identify critical actions
3. Schedule Focus tier activities
4. Block time for Maintain tier
5. Note Monitor checks

### Daily Execution

| Time Block | Activity |
|------------|----------|
| Morning | Focus tier — deep work |
| Mid-day | Meetings |
| Afternoon | Maintain tier — keep moving |
| End of day | Quick checks, admin |

### Friday Review (30 min)

1. What moved this week?
2. What didn't move? Why?
3. Any tier changes needed?
4. Next week priorities

## Effort ROI Analysis

### High ROI Activities

| Activity | Typical Impact |
|----------|----------------|
| Discovery meeting | Stage advancement |
| Champion enablement | Internal selling |
| Technical validation | Removes objection |
| Executive meeting | Accelerates deal |

### Low ROI Activities

| Activity | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| Excessive follow-ups | Annoying, not moving |
| Generic content | Doesn't resonate |
| Premature proposals | Wastes effort |
| Unqualified leads | Low conversion |

### ROI Optimization

- Spend 80% on high-ROI activities
- Batch low-ROI activities
- Automate where possible
- Delegate admin work

---

## Rebalancing Triggers

### Move Deal Up

- Urgency increased
- Champion went active
- Budget confirmed
- Competition appeared

### Move Deal Down

- Champion went cold
- Timeline pushed
- Blocked externally
- Lost momentum

### Remove from Active

- Qualified out
- Closed (won or lost)
- Pushed to future quarter
- No response after X attempts

---

## Effort Tracking

### Simple Log

```
Week of Feb 3:
- BigTech: 3 hrs (contract follow-up, legal review)
- ShopCo: 5 hrs (discovery, CTO prep, follow-up)
- RetailPlus: 2 hrs (meeting, next steps)
- Other: 10 hrs (leads, admin, internal)
```

### Efficiency Check

Ask weekly:
1. Did Focus tier get 60% of time?
2. Did any deal get zero attention?
3. Was effort aligned to priority?
4. What would I do differently?
