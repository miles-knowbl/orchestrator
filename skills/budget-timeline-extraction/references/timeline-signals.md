# Timeline Signals Reference

Types of timeline indicators and how to interpret them.

## Hard Deadline Signals

### Calendar Date

**What it looks like:**

- "Deadline is March 15"
- "Go-live date is April 1"

**Confidence:** High — specific date given

**Flexibility:** Low — there's a reason for this date

**Interpretation:** Work backward from date. Can we deliver?

### Event-Driven

**What it looks like:**
- "Before our busy season"

**Interpretation:** Missing this deadline may kill the deal. Prioritize.

### Regulatory/Compliance

**What it looks like:**
- "Compliance deadline in June"
- "New regulation takes effect [date]"
- "Audit is scheduled for [date]"

**Confidence:** High — external, immovable

**Flexibility:** None — regulatory deadlines don't slip

|--------|---------------|
| Urgency without budget | May be tire kicking |

## Timeline Questions to Ask

When timeline unclear, probe with:

1. "When do you need to be live?"
2. "What's driving that timeline?"
3. "Is that a hard deadline or a target?"
4. "What happens if you miss that date?"
5. "When do you need to make a decision?"
6. "What's your evaluation process and timeline?"

## Implementation vs. Decision Timeline

**Decision Timeline:** When will they choose a vendor?
**Implementation Timeline:** When do they need to be live?

These are different:
- Decision in Q1, Implementation in Q3 = plenty of time
- Decision in Q2, Implementation in Q2 = compressed, risky
- No decision timeline = may not be buying soon

Always clarify both.
