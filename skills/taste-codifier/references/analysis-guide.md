# Taste Analysis Guide

How to extract voice patterns from diverse source material to populate a taste schema.

## Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Source Inventory

Before analysis, catalog all sources:

```
Text Sources:
- Documents (docx, pdf, md, txt)
- Transcripts (video/podcast/interview)
- Social media posts
- Emails/newsletters
- Published articles

Image Sources:
- Graphics/infographics
- Photography
- Slide decks
- Social media images
- Brand materials

Video Sources:
- Presentations
- Interviews
- Social content
- Tutorials
```

Count and categorize. This informs confidence levels.

### Phase 2: Textual Pattern Extraction

#### 2.1 Narrative Mechanics

**Arc Detection:**
Read through content looking for story patterns. For each story:
1. Identify the starting state (shame, weakness, rejection, fear, problem)
2. Identify the ending state (liberation, strength, fit, mastery, creation)
3. Note the transformation mechanism
4. Record frequency of each arc type

**Specificity Mining:**
- Extract all numbers (exact counts, times, percentages)
- Note number style (precise: "27 hours" vs rounded: "about 30")
- Collect sensory details (physical sensations, environment descriptions)
- List all proper nouns (people, places, institutions, pop culture references)

#### 2.2 Rhetorical Signature

**Analogy Mapping:**
For each explanation of an abstract concept:
1. What source domain is used? (sports, cooking, gaming, etc.)
2. What's the structural mapping?
3. How is it introduced? ("It's like...", "Think of it as...", "Imagine...")

**Humor Analysis:**
For each humorous moment:
1. Classify mode (self-deprecating, absurdist, observational, wordplay)
2. Identify function (disarms before credentials, softens after vulnerability, creates memory)
3. Note placement patterns

**Inversion Detection:**
Look for contrarian positions:
1. What conventional wisdom is stated?
2. What opposite position is taken?
3. What proof is offered?

#### 2.3 Emotional Architecture

**Vulnerability Inventory:**
- Shame admissions: What does the voice admit was embarrassing/shameful?
- Fear admissions: What fears are acknowledged?
- Failure admissions: What failures are owned?
- Check: Are vulnerabilities specific + past + overcome?

**Triumph Pairing:**
For each success mentioned:
1. What struggle preceded it?
2. How is improbability framed?
3. What present-day proof validates it?

**Gratitude Mapping:**
- Who is thanked?
- For what specific action?
- With what specific impact noted?

#### 2.4 Identity Threads

**Claim Extraction:**
- "I am..." statements (identity labels)
- "I do..." statements (action-based identity—stronger)
- "I believe..." statements (worldview)

**Belonging Analysis:**
- What made them an outsider?
- What moment marked belonging?
- How do they bridge both worlds now?

#### 2.5 Teaching Moves

**Framework Inventory:**
- Named frameworks (look for numbers, alliteration, metaphors in titles)
- Component structure
- When each framework is deployed

**Advice Pattern:**
- Common advice being challenged
- Their alternative position
- Lived proof backing it

#### 2.6 Audience Relationship

**Hook Identification:**
- What feelings create instant recognition? (imposter syndrome, being behind, hiding struggles)
- How are hooks phrased? (first person internal monologue preferred)
- Where do hooks appear?

**Intimacy Moments:**
- Private rituals shared
- Family moments revealed
- Spiritual/personal practices disclosed

**Permission Extraction:**
What is the audience implicitly/explicitly allowed to feel/do/be?

#### 2.7 Signature Phrases

Collect recurring language:
- Opening patterns
- Transition phrases
- Closing moves

### Phase 3: Visual Pattern Extraction

#### 3.1 Color Analysis

From images/graphics/presentations:
- Dominant colors (what appears most)
- Supporting colors
- Accent colors for emphasis
- Color temperature (warm/cool)
- Saturation levels (muted/vibrant)
- Contrast approach (high/low)

#### 3.2 Typography Analysis

- Heading characteristics (weight, style, personality)
- Body text approach (readability, density)
- Accent typography (quotes, callouts)
- Hierarchy patterns

#### 3.3 Composition Analysis

- Layout patterns (grid, asymmetric, centered)
- Whitespace approach (dense/airy)
- Visual flow direction
- Element grouping patterns

#### 3.4 Imagery Analysis

- Illustration style (if present)
- Icon style (line weight, fill, complexity)
- Recurring visual motifs
- Photography style (if present)
- Visual metaphor patterns

#### 3.5 Mood Analysis

- Overall energy level
- Texture presence
- Lighting tendencies (in photos/illustrations)
- Emotional register

### Phase 4: Anti-Pattern Identification

Review for what's conspicuously absent:
- What content patterns are never used?
- What visual approaches are avoided?
- What topics are off-limits?
- What tones don't appear?

The absence of patterns is as informative as their presence.

### Phase 5: Confidence Calibration

Rate confidence based on:

**High Confidence (abundant evidence):**
- 20+ text sources across multiple formats
- 10+ image sources
- Consistent patterns appearing 70%+ of the time
- Multiple contexts represented

**Medium Confidence (moderate evidence):**
- 5-20 text sources
- 3-10 image sources
- Patterns appearing 40-70% of the time
- Some variety in contexts

**Low Confidence (limited evidence):**
- Fewer than 5 text sources
- Fewer than 3 image sources
- Patterns appearing less than 40%
- Limited context variety

For low-confidence dimensions, still fill all fields but mark extrapolations clearly in the schema.

### Phase 6: Cross-Validation

Before finalizing:
1. Read schema aloud—does it sound like the voice?
2. Could someone unfamiliar recreate the voice from this schema?
3. Are there contradictions between dimensions?
4. Is anything critical missing?

## Analysis Shortcuts

**For time-constrained analysis:**

If you have limited sources, prioritize extraction in this order:
1. Essence (core DNA, values, emotional signature)
2. Narrative mechanics (arc types, specificity)
3. Emotional architecture (vulnerability formula, triumph pairing)
4. Rhetorical signature (analogies, inversions)
5. Audience relationship (hooks, permissions)
6. Visual dimensions (if any visual sources exist)
7. Everything else

This order captures the most voice-defining elements first.

## Common Extraction Mistakes

- **Over-generalizing**: "Uses humor" vs "Self-deprecating humor placed before credentials to disarm"
- **Missing anti-patterns**: Not documenting what's absent
- **Confusing topic with voice**: Recording WHAT they talk about, not HOW they talk
- **Insufficient examples**: Listing patterns without signature examples
- **Visual-textual mismatch**: Visual style that doesn't match textual emotional register
