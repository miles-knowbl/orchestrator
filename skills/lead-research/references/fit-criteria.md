## Fit Score Calculation

```
Fit Score = (Industry × 0.30) + (Size × 0.25) +
            (Need × 0.30) + (Technical × 0.15)
```

### Example Calculation

**ShopCo (E-commerce, 500 employees):**

- Industry: E-commerce = 95
- Size: 500 employees = 95
- Need: Hiring support roles, recent funding = 80
- Technical: E-commerce = modern = 75

```
Fit = (95 × 0.30) + (95 × 0.25) + (80 × 0.30) + (75 × 0.15)
    = 28.5 + 23.75 + 24 + 11.25
    = 87.5
```

**Result:** Excellent fit (87.5)
