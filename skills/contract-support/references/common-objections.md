## Negotiation Principles

### Know Your Limits

| Term | Preferred | Acceptable | Walk Away |
|------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Liability cap | 2x ACV | 1x ACV | Below 1x |
| Payment terms | Net 30 | Net 45 | Net 90+ |
| Termination | Annual | 6 mo minimum | At-will |

### Trading Points

Use less important concessions to get important ones:

"We can do Net 45 if you agree to annual commitment"

### Escalation Triggers

Escalate to leadership if:
- Deal size warrants
- Non-standard terms requested
- Potential precedent-setting
- Legal risk concern
- Deadline pressure

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Better Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Concede too quickly | Hold for trade |
| Explain too much | Simple position |
| Get emotional | Stay professional |
| Ignore small issues | Address all concerns |
| Rush at the end | Maintain process |
