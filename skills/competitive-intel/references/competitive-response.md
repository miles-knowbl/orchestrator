4. **Escalate** — May need executive or champion help

**Tactics:**

### Build vs. Buy (Internal Option)

**Situation:** They're considering building it themselves.

**Response Strategy:**
1. **Respect** — Technical teams often want to build
2. **TCO** — Total cost of ownership comparison
3. **Time** — Speed to value
4. **Expertise** — You've done this before
5. **Focus** — Their core competency isn't [your product]

**Tactics:**

**TCO Analysis:**
| Factor | Build | Buy |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Initial Development | $500K+ | $0 |
| Ongoing Maintenance | $200K/year | $0 |
| Time to Market | 12+ months | 2 months |
| Risk | High (unproven) | Low (proven) |
| Opportunity Cost | Engineers distracted | Engineers on core product |

**Talk Track:**
- "What's the opportunity cost of having your team build this vs. your core product?"
- "How many AI support systems has your team built before?"
- "What happens if your key engineer leaves?"

---

### Status Quo (Do Nothing)

**Situation:** They're considering not changing anything.

**Response Strategy:**
1. **Cost of inaction** — What are they losing every day?
2. **Urgency** — What's driving timeline?
3. **Competition** — Their competitors are adopting AI
4. **ROI** — Clear payback period
5. **Risk** — Not changing is also risky

**Tactics:**
- Quantify current pain in dollars
- "Every month you wait costs $X"
- "Your competitor [name] is using AI for this"
- Show risk of falling behind
- Offer low-risk pilot

## Competitive Positioning Guidelines

### Lead With

- Your unique differentiators
- Customer success stories
- Specific metrics/results
- Areas where you genuinely excel

### Avoid

- Unsubstantiated competitor criticism
- Claims you can't prove
- Defensive positioning
- Feature-by-feature comparison (commodity trap)

### When Asked Directly

**"How do you compare to [competitor]?"**

Good response:
"I can share what our customers who evaluated both say they value about us:
1. [Differentiator 1]
2. [Differentiator 2]
3. [Differentiator 3]

Rather than me telling you what's different, would it be helpful to talk to a customer who made this exact decision?"
