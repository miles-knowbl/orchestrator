# Communication Capture Guidelines

What to capture, what to skip, and how to prioritize.

## The "Give to Grow" Filter

Every communication should pass through the "Give to Grow" lens:

> Does this communication contain signals about how we can **help** this prospect?

If yes → Capture it.
If it's just logistics with no signal → Skip or summarize briefly.

## High-Priority Capture (Always)

### Pain Point Signals

Capture any communication that reveals:
- Volume/capacity issues
- Authentication/security needs
- Knowledge base gaps
- Legacy system limitations
- Compliance requirements
- Customer experience problems
- Cost pressures
- Scaling challenges

**Examples:**
- "We're drowning in support tickets"
- "Our current system can't handle the load"
- "We need this for SOC 2 compliance"

### Budget & Timeline Signals

Capture any mention of:
- Specific budget numbers or ranges
- Fiscal year constraints
- Decision deadlines
- Procurement process details
- Board/executive timelines
- "Need this by X date"

**Examples:**
- "We have $200-400K approved for this"
- "Need to have something in place by Q2"
- "Budget cycle ends in March"

### Stakeholder Intelligence

Capture communications that reveal:
- New stakeholders
- Org structure
- Decision-making process
- Internal politics
- Champion advocacy
- Blocker concerns

**Examples:**
- "I'll need to loop in our CTO"
- "Legal will want to review this"
- "My VP is very excited about this"

### Technical Requirements

Capture discussions about:
- Integration needs
- Data sources
- Authentication systems
- Scalability requirements
- Security/compliance needs
- Existing tech stack

### Competitive Intelligence

Capture mentions of:
- Other vendors being evaluated
- Build vs. buy considerations
- Previous vendor experiences
- Competitor features/pricing

### Use Case Definition

Capture anything that clarifies:
- What they want to automate
- Specific workflows
- Success criteria
- Scope boundaries

## Medium-Priority Capture

### Relationship Building

Capture if it reveals:
- Personal connection points
- Communication preferences
- Relationship dynamics
- Trust indicators

### Meeting Logistics (with Context)

Capture if the logistics email also contains:
- Agenda that reveals priorities
- Attendee list that shows stakeholder involvement
- Context that explains why meeting is happening

### Status Updates

Capture if they contain:
- Progress signals
- Blockers
- Timeline changes
- Stakeholder changes

## Low-Priority (Skip or Brief Summary)

### Pure Logistics

Skip:
- "What time works for you?"
- "Here's the Zoom link"
- "Running 5 min late"

Unless they contain additional context.

### Acknowledgments

Skip:
- "Thanks!"
- "Got it"
- "Sounds good"

Unless they indicate decision/agreement.

### Friendly Banter

Skip casual conversation unless it reveals:
- Relationship strength signals
- Personal context useful for connection

### Marketing Materials Sent

Don't duplicate content. Just note:
- What was sent
- When
- Any customization done

## Capture Depth Guidelines

### Full Capture

For high-signal communications:
- Complete text
- All participants
- Full context
- Attachments listed

### Summary Capture

For medium-signal communications:
- Key points only
- Participants involved
- Date
- Link to original if available

### Skip

For low-signal communications:
- Don't create a file
- If part of a thread, note "logistics exchange" in the thread file

## Privacy & Sensitivity

### Always Capture

- Business discussions
- Technical details
- Timeline/budget (even if ranges)
- Stakeholder roles

### Capture with Care

- Salary/compensation mentions (may signal budget)
- Internal politics (useful but sensitive)
- Competitor pricing (if shared)

### Never Capture

- Personal health information
- Non-business personal details
- Confidential information clearly marked as such
- Information that was explicitly "off the record"

## Timing Guidelines

### Capture Immediately

- Meeting notes (within 24 hours while fresh)
- Important decision emails
- Stakeholder introductions
- Timeline/budget confirmations

### Capture Within 48 Hours

- Standard follow-up emails
- Technical discussion emails
- Status updates

### Batch Capture Weekly

- Low-priority status emails
- Logistics threads (if capturing at all)

## Quality Over Quantity

**Better:** 5 well-captured, high-signal communications
**Worse:** 20 poorly-captured low-signal communications

Focus on communications that will:
1. Improve deal scoring accuracy
2. Enable better next-best-action recommendations
3. Help champion enablement
4. Surface risks early

## Red Flags to Always Capture

Even if the communication seems routine, capture if it contains:

- **Silence breakers:** First response after long silence
- **Sentiment shifts:** Tone change (positive or negative)
- **New names:** Anyone new entering the conversation
- **Timeline mentions:** Any date or deadline
- **Budget mentions:** Any number or range
- **Competitor mentions:** Any vendor name
- **Concern signals:** "I'm worried about...", "My concern is..."
- **Urgency signals:** "ASAP", "urgent", "critical"
- **Blockers:** "We can't proceed until...", "Legal needs to..."
