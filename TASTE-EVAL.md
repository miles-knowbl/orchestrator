# Taste Evaluation: Orchestrator

## Overall Taste Score: 8.5/10

## Dimensions

### 1. Coherence (9/10)
The system has a clear, unified vision: skills as atomic primitives that compose into loops. Every component reinforces this mental model.

### 2. Elegance (8/10)
Clean separation of concerns. Services are well-isolated. The guarantee system is particularly elegant - belt-and-suspenders validation without being heavy-handed.

### 3. Momentum (9/10)
Excellent forward motion. The leverage protocol ensures every action compounds. Auto-approve gates enable "it works while I sleep" workflows.

### 4. Friction Points (7/10)
- MCP endpoint requires special handling for HTTP clients
- Some API routes missing (had to use MCP tools)
- Voice only works on Mac (not phone)

### 5. Delight (8/10)
Slack integration is genuinely delightful - approve loops from your phone while jogging. The Dream State concept creates real excitement about progress.

## Taste Verdict

This is a **craftsman's tool** - opinionated, powerful, rewarding to master. It respects the user's intelligence and compounds their leverage over time.
